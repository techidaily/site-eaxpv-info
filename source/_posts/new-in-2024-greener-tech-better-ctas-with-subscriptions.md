## Methods to add a subscribe button to your video

Viewers are not likely to subscribe to any channel if they are not guided. One best method is to engage a subscribe button to your video and draw the attention of as many as possible.

#### 1 Use Subscribe Green Screen

Put your green screen to work by subscribing to it. Follow these steps to produce eye-catching videos, with a call to action closing point.

**Step 1\. Set screen**
You need to create a background at the Studio – and that's the green screen. Keenly hand it on a frame before you start filming. Also, note that no wrinkles or fold-ups are visible.

![how to make subscribe green screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-2.png)

**Step 2\. Adjust lighting**  
Lighting is important to facilitate high-resolution video output quality. Put appropriate lighting settings to avoid directional shadows and get the best results.

**Step 3\. Set up the subject**  
Give ample space between the subject and the green screen for an effective outcome. If they are too close, there will be a reflection of the green screen on the subject. It isn't professional as it will be hard when it comes to matching to a different background.

![make your own green screen - set up the object](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-3.png)

**Step 4\. Start filming**  
Begin to film your video and ensure you take various shots for comparison. It is good to film at different angles to see what works best.

**Step 5\. Polish the rough cut**  
Tune all the footage to perfect video clips. It will save your efforts when keying out green screen footage. Remove the unwanted parts by trimming. You can also do other edits like merge and split where necessary.

**Step 6\. Key out the footage and edit the green screen**  
Your footage is now ready, and you are now free to edit the green screen. It is better to engage reliable editing software to remove the green traces in the shot.

**Step 7\. Paste the new background**  
Any background concept can now fit in. Add your desired background video or image in a new layer below the subject. You can continue to make other necessary adjustments like sharpness and hue for reality.

**Step 8\. Add Call To Action**  
Finally, tell your viewers to subscribe to your YouTube channel while watching the video. You can also introduce your other channels that aren't yet known or those that have not reached 1,000 subscribers.

#### 2 Using YouTube Studio

You can also enable the green screen to subscribe via the YouTube Studio. It is a YouTube application that provides you with the tools you need to create a successful YouTube channel. You can manage your videos, respond to comments and even add adverts to your content for pay. Here are the steps to add subscribe button.

**Step 1**. First, go directly to "studio.youtube.com" or click on your profile picture on the YouTube page to launch YT Studio.

The M50 is also the only camera on our list that you can buy at a prosumer's budget that shoots 4K video. Yes, the Sony a7R III and Panasonic GH5S also shoot 4K video, but they are much more expensive. With Canon's new DIGIC 8 Image Processor, the camera's dual-pixel autofocusing system will perform even better.  **PROS** _\- Can shoot UHD 4K videos at 23.98 fps_ _\- Has a 2.36m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder_   **CONS** _\- No image stabilization_ _\- Battery life could be longer_                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| ![Mirrorless Cameras 4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirrorless-cameras-4.png) | Best entry-level mirrorless camera for vlogging: Canon EOS M100 The Canon EOS M100 is a small, but powerful mirrorless camera for vlogging. This camera can shoot full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. It cannot shoot 4K video, unfortunately. It uses its DIGIC 7 Image Processor and dual-pixel autofocusing system to ensure that your vlogs are always in focus. The M100 provides great ISO sensitivity options - it can reach up to ISO 25600. With its built-in Wi-Fi with NFC, you can transfer your media seamlessly to a computer.  **PROS** _\- Affordable_ _\- Great connectivity options_   **CONS** _\- Lacks advanced video recording features_ _\- No viewfinder_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ![Mirrorless Cameras 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirrorless-cameras-1.png) | Best mid-range mirrorless camera for vlogging: Canon EOS M50 The Canon EOS M50 wins this category as well in our books. It is the only camera on our list that shoots 4K video that is priced much lower than the Sony a7R III and the Panasonic GH7S. In case you missed it, check out my review on the [Canon EOS M50](#Best-daily-mirrorless-camera-for-vlogging).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| ![Mirrorless Cameras 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirrorless-cameras-2.png) | Best professional mirrorless camera for vlogging: Panasonic Lumix DC-GH5S Originally, Panasonic had released it's GH5 as a hybrid camera that handles both photography and videography well. In response to hearing customers' interest in a more video-focused camera, Panasonic came up with the GH5S. In our list of the top mirrorless cameras, the Panasonic GH5S and the Sony a7R III are the two professional mirrorless cameras that can record 4K video. Between the two, though, the GH5S wins as the best professional mirrorless camera for vlogging because it sports a fully-articulated screen. Its micro four-thirds sensor is smaller than the a7R III's full-frame sensor. Even with a smaller sensor, though, the GH5S is made to still autofocus well in low lighting conditions. Another amazing feature is its ability to record 240 fps slow-motion video at full HD 1080p.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 204800_ _\- High video bit rates_   **CONS** _\- Expensive_ _\- The camera body weighs about 1.5 lbs_ |
