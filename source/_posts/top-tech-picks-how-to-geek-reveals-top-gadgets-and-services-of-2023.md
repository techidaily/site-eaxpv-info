## Top Tech Picks: How-To Geek Reveals Top Gadgets and Services of 2023

It's easy to debate the best or worst products of the year, but these are How-To Geek's 12 favorites from 2023\. This isn't just a hypothetical list of products that look cool or seem like they might be good.

Sergio Rodriguez / How-To Geek

 The [Lenovo Legion 9i Gen 8](https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/test-ride-the-convenient-mods-updated-sidecar-electric-bike/) is a powerful laptop aimed at playing top-tier games and has a lot of features to support that goal. There's a capable CPU and GPU, as well as per-key RGB lights and an integrated liquid cooling system, to name a few.

**Why it's great**: As reviewer Cianna Garrison writes, "Serious gamers want serious performance from a gaming laptop, and for the most part, the 16-inch Lenovo Legion 9i (2023) serves up gaming on a silver platter. With a top-tier NVIDIA GPU and an HX-rated Intel Core i9 processor, the Legion 9i offers speed, accuracy, a gorgeous chassis, and a 3.2K display for all the eye candy you could want."

Tyler Hayes / How-To Geek

 On paper, very little is exciting about the [Nomad 65W Slim Power Adapter](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-mastering-language-free-top-8-srt-translation-websites/). It's a charger that features dual USB-C ports and is capable of producing up to 65W of power. Its winning characteristic is its small size, thanks to GaN technology.

**Why it’s great**: The true value of the 65W Slim adapter is that it’s slim and small enough to fit in a front jeans pocket. This GaN device could significantly cut down on the weight and bulk of the items you travel with but is still powerful enough to charge a MacBook Air or Surface laptop.

Tyler Hayes / How-To Geek

 The [Sony WF-1000XM5](https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/navigating-networked-video-streaming-with-vlc-for-2024/) wireless earbuds make substantial gains in multiple areas over previous models while continuing to deliver rich and powerful sound quality.

**Why they're great**: A slimmed-down size makes these premium earbuds much easier to use for longer periods. These are much more comfortable compared to the [1000XM4 earbuds](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/mastering-maximum-payload-heavy-lift-drones-for-2024/). Active noise-canceling technology is great on these earbuds, too. Touch controls remain fiddly, but the product is a huge step forward overall. (Sony, please add Wide Area Tap to all your earbuds!)

![Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses sitting on grass](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-sitting-on-grass.JPG) 

Tyler Hayes / How-To Geek

 The [Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses](https://fox-that.techidaily.com/safari-on-iphone-running-slow-learn-how-to-make-it-zoom-ahead-in-just-4-steps/) are the company’s second attempt at camera and speaker glasses, but this time, it nailed the objective. The glasses feature a 12MP camera, lots of microphones, and speakers in the stems.

**Why they're great**: Above all, the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses have fantastic speakers embedded and make listening to music easy without plugging your ears. The camera for photos and videos is solid. Plus, the Meta AI assistant is at least interesting and not a complete waste of time. All bundled together, the pieces make for a compelling product in a stylish, timeless design.

![Front camera and LiDAR sensors shown on the Roborock S8 Pro Ultra](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1b549450.jpg) 

Justin Duino / Review Geek

 The [Roborock S8 Pro Ultra](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/updated-canons-spectral-conversion-paid-and-gratis-lut-tools/) is one of the most advanced robot vacuums with 6,000Pa suction, improved mopping, astute object avoidance in all lighting conditions, a long battery life, and a docking station capable of holding seven weeks' worth of dirt.

**Why it’s great**: The S8 Pro Ultra uses its advanced specs to have minimal impact on your daily life while keeping the floors tidy. It bumps into fewer things and gets into fewer predicaments, meaning less hassle for owners. As long as you can empty its dirty water every other week, it doesn’t need much assistance to be your cleaning assistant.

##  Sonos Era 300

![sonos era 300 in white](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/3941f0fd.jpg) 

Tyler Hayes / How-To Geek

 The [Sonos Era 300](https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/n-2024-unlocking-superior-sound-recordings-minus-the-mic/) is one of the first consumer speakers to go all-in on spatial audio, built for Dolby Atmos music. It features an up-firing driver and plenty of oomph to fill a living room or act as a rear surround sound speaker when two Era 300s are paired with a Sonos soundbar.

**Why it’s great**: Dolby Atmos mixed tracks feature depth, height, and wide-reaching instrumentation. The Era 300 is truly a transformational speaker for listening at home. It’s compact but able to produce rich and well-rounded music. It has a line-in, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and AirPlay connectivity. Plus, when used as surround sound speakers, it gives movies real height and dimension.

Bill Loguidice / How-To Geek

 The [DJI Mini 4 Pro](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/updated-audio-dimming-techniques-in-logic-pro/) is a slick, prosumer drone that packs a lot of previously high-end features into a more affordable package for people who want cinematic shots.

**Why it’s great**: The Mini 4 Pro might not be an entry-level drone because of its price, but it’s dead simple to use for beginners or enthusiasts. There are lots of automated and pre-set shot types that do all the work and look spectacular captured on the integrated camera.

![DJI Mini 4 Pro and RC 2 remote control on a white background](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/617rfzwf0fl-_ac_sl1500_.jpg)

Hannah Stryker / How-To Geek

 The [Amazon Echo Dot with Clock (5th-Gen)](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-restoring-your-hidden-snap-content-for-2024/) keeps the same sphere form factor as the previous model but adds in some new features like a temperature sensor to get local temps and an accelerometer for gesture controls.

**Why it's great**: Having a built-in temperature sensor means you can ask Alexa about how cold it is in your room. The accelerometer allows you to hit or tap the Dot to snooze an alarm or to stop timers.

Tyler Hayes / How-To Geek

 The [Ember Tumbler](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/adopt-smart-installers-handbook-for-auto-gpt/) is a 16-ounce mug that keeps drinks hot between 120F and 145F (50C-62.5C) for up to three hours. No need to rush to finish your morning coffee or tea.

**Why it’s great**: The Ember Tumbler isn’t a revolutionary departure from the company’s other drinkware products that keep liquid warm, but its larger size, multiple lids included, and versatile shape make it perfect for home or travel use. A single cup that can do it all.

 There were a plethora of neat electronics and products released in 2023 that didn't make the cut for the list but are still worth highlighting. For example, the [**Boox Palma**](https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/can-t-play-mov-files-on-motorola-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mov-on-android/) is a phone-sized eReader that excels at portability and makes reading on the go easier when it can quickly be stuffed into nearly any pocket.

 The [**iPhone 15 Pro**](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-direct-interaction-enhancing-live-broadcasts-with-desktop-share/) might look similar to last year's model, but its titanium frame makes it feel lighter and nicer to hold. Plus, Apple's latest phone continues to get better at photography.

 The [**Rivian R1S**](https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/understanding-artificnial-intelligence-insights-and-potential-risks/) is a stunning electric vehicle. It may cost too much for a lot of people to afford, but its 7-seat configuration, comfortable ride, and off-road capabilities make it a truly special SUV.

 Ebikes continue to take over the mobility space, and the **[Tenways CGO600 Pro](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/demystifying-the-purpose-what-is-a-blue-image-on-facebook-for-2024/)** is a smooth, fun ride that's also lightweight and easy to maneuver wherever you store it.

 More products released in 2023 could be celebrated, but the time has come to turn the attention to a new, upcoming year. How-To Geek will be covering CES 2024 in early January with full reviews of all the new gear and gadgets to follow. Stay tuned.
