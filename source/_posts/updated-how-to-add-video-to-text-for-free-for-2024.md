It may be challenging to capture the attention of your audience if the video openings or PowerPoint presentations contain too much text. Striking a perfect balance between the visual and textual elements isn’t always easy, especially if the text is the only way to convey essential information to the audience.

Luckily, video editing and presentation software products offer the tools you will need to combine video and text. In this article, we are going to show you how to add a video to text in PowerPoint and Filmora.

## Part 1: How to Add Video to Text for Free with PowerPoint?

An effective PowerPoint presentation should contain proportionate amounts of textual and visual elements. Using too many images, videos or animations can make following a presentation difficult, just as too much text can render a presentation too static.

Adding videos to titles or subtitles you include in a slideshow you’re creating in PowerPoint can help you create a presentation that is both informative and visually entertaining. The process of combining videos with text in PowerPoint isn’t overly complicated, but you will still need to go through it several times in order to become familiar with it.

You should start by creating a new slide and adding a textbox to it. Proceed to type the word or phrase into the textbox and go on to format the text. Pick the font that matches the style of your presentation and make sure that the text size is large enough for the video to be visible.

Head over to the Insert tab, select Rectangle from the Shapes menu, and create a rectangular shape over the entire slide. Right-click on the slide and choose the Send to Back option from the menu. In this manner, you will position the rectangle you created behind the textbox.

The next step you will have to take is to create the cut-out of the text within the rectangle. Select both the text and shape you placed in the background before clicking on the Format tab that is located near the end of PowerPoint’s ribbon.

Find the Insert Shape option and choose Subtract from the Merge Shapes drop-down menu. The shape of the text in the textbox will be applied to the object in the background, which enables you to add a video to that text.

![Add video to text - Powerpoint- substract](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subtract-from-merge-shapes.jpg)

Click on the Insert tab, and then choose the Video option from the Media menu. You can [insert a video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that is stored on a local hard drive or the Internet to PowerPoint. The video will cover the entire slide, so you must right-click on it and select the Send to Back option.

You can then fine-tune the video playback settings from the Playback tab. Preview the results before you move on to the next slide in your presentation, and make necessary adjustments if you don’t like how the video merged with the text.

## Part 2: Adding Video to Text in Filmora

Besides presentation software, you can also use video editing software products to add a video to text. Filmora lets you add a video to text in just a few simple steps. You can first make a text video with animation first, and then use the picture in picture feature to add the video to text. Here are the detailed information about how to add a video to text in Filmora.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

You should start by creating a new project in Filmora and importing the video you want to add to the text into the project. Click on the Titles tab, and choose the title that matches the visual style of your project.

![Add video to text - Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-title-effects.jpg)

Set the preferred duration of the title by dragging one of its ends to the left or right after you place it on the timeline, and then double-click on it to customize it. Click on the Advanced button once the Text tab opens and insert the text into the Input Text box.

![Add video to text - Filmora9 Advanced Editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-text-video-advanced-text-edit.jpg)

Proceed to select a font and adjust the text size before deciding if you want to [animate the text](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). When done, you should export the title as a video file, and then import it back into your project.

Now it’s time to add the text video and the background video to the project media library, and then place the two videos one above the other. Since we’re adding video to text, the text video should be placed above the background video.

![Add video to text - Filmora9 Compositing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/compositing-video-9.jpg)

Click on the video that contains text to gain access to the Video tab of the Editor panel and then expand the Compositing menu. Change the Blending Mode to Multiply, and the text in the overlaying video should be filled with the parts of the footage from the video below it.

Optionally you can enhance the colors in the background video or adjust the size of the text before exporting your project from Filmora.

**Conclusion**

There are so many different ways to create visually striking content, and adding videos to text is just one among numerous techniques that enable you to make a PowerPoint presentation or an opening of a video more interesting to watch.

Merging text with video is equally easy in PowerPoint and Filmora, so you just have to choose which software better suits your needs and select the materials that fit the style of your project. Learning how to add a video to text won’t take too much of your time, as this process can be completed in just a few quick steps. Which software are you using to add a video to text?

## Step-by-Step Guide to Producing Quality Mobile Videos

# How To Make YouTube Videos on Your Smartphone

 It is fun to be able to record a vlog entry whenever inspiration strikes you, and your smartphone is a great choice for recording on the go. Smartphones have really great cameras, and you probably always have your phone with you. You can even post directly from your phone to YouTube!

## How To Make YouTube Videos on Your Smartphone

 Making a video on your smartphone is similar to making a video with any other camera in a lot of ways. There are also a lot of ways in which it is different. You always have to watch out for camera shake, for example, but it can be even harder to control when you’re walking around shooting on your mobile device. Here are three things to keep in mind when vlogging with your smartphone.

#### Part 1\. Keep It Steady

 For a nice, smooth, shot consider resting your hand up on a railing, table, or anything else that will keep it steady while you film. Camera shake is always distracting to viewers, and smartphone videos are notoriously unstable because you are almost always holding your phone in your hand.

 There is equipment you can use to cut out camera shake. You can get a smartphone mount for your tripod, or you can even stabilize your phone using a selfie stick. Many of the very newest smartphones have built in hardware called ‘OIS’ – optical image stabilization – that helps reduce shakiness.

#### Part 2\. Be Heard

 You have a lot to say, so make sure people can hear you say it! Smartphones do not tend to have very good microphones built in (neither do most cameras), so try to vlog from somewhere without a lot of background noise. It will help a lot if your voice has nothing to compete with.

 Ideally, you should get an external mic to record your voice while you vlog on your phone. There are shotgun mics you can plug directly into the audio jack on your phone which will record great audio, or you can get a high quality MP3 recorder and carry it around in your pocket.

#### Part 3\. Tilt Your Phone

 When recording on the spur of the moment with your smartphone it is easy to automatically hold it the same way you would while texting or taking a selfie. If you record a video with your phone held so that it is tall – a ‘portrait’ shot – then your video will have thick black bars on either side when you post it to YouTube. If you tilt your phone so that it is wide you will record a ‘landscape’ shot, which will match the dimensions YouTube plays videos in.

 The exception to this is videos you plan to post on Instagram. On Instagram everything is cropped into a square, and it is easier to imagine what your footage will look like as a square when you hold your phone strait up. Simply focus on the top of your screen and treat a portion of the bottom of your screen as if it is not there. When you hold your phone horizontally you need to try and estimate how much of the middle of your screen will make it in to your Instagram video, which can be awkward.

 Those are the three main things to keep in mind, but if you are planning on posting directly to YouTube from your phone then you should also make sure you have a mobile app you can use to edit it first.

[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)is a full-feature video editing app available for both Android and iPhone operating systems. With Filmora you can make awesome YouTube videos quickly using Filmora’s one-touch themes, or take a little bit more time personalizing your creation. One-touch themes are sets of related features, like filters and animated titles, which you can apply to your videos all at once. Filmora’s simple interface also makes it easy to apply filters, titles, overlays, transitions, and even royalty free music to your project one at a time.

 After you’ve edited your video in Filmora you can post it directly to YouTube or other social media sites right from the app.
