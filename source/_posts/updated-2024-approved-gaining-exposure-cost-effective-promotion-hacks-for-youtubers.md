* [Step 1: Find Good Keywords for Your YouTube Videos](#one)
* [Step 2: Make Full Use of Your Video's Tags](#two)

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## 1\. Find Good Keywords for Your YouTube Videos

The keywords that you choose to use with your video will be the greatest factors in determining whether your video will actually be found by viewers searching for content like yours on YouTube. You need to be intelligent and choose strong keywords that are highly related to both your video and your niche on YouTube. Without the use of good keywords, your video will simply become lost in the endless stream of content being uploaded to YouTube, and audiences who might enjoy it will never get a chance to see it.

Consider doing some keyword research into your video’s subject using the Google Keyword Planner in or a variety of other [keyword tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Make sure the most important keywords are in your tags, title, and description.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://mushroom-supplies.sjv.io/c/5597632/1692242/18134" target="_top" id="1692242"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18134-1692242" border="0" alt="" width="834" height="592"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1692242/18134" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 2\. Make Full Use of Your Video's Tags

Tags are essential. A lot of creators either skip tags or only put in 1-5, and their actions will benefit you if you choose to use a lot.

Loading up your tags with keywords that are relevant to your video and genre will help your video appear in the viewer’s search results, which will earn you a lot more views. When users are looking for specific information, like how to recover lost data, just including things like ‘lost data’, ‘data recovery’, and even the full phrase ‘how to recover lost data’ in your video’s tags will give you a greater chance to actually appear in search engine results.

Including the maximum amount of tags possible will help to give YouTube the maximum amount of information to use in order to place your video in the results of different searches or to have it come up as ‘related’ to other videos. Users that only post 3 or 4 tags with each video could be missing out on countless amounts of traffic for their content.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2086436/19576" target="_top" id="2086436"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2086436" border="0" alt="" width="1500" height="400"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2086436/19576" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 3\. Post a Transcript in Your Video Description

If you have a script or a transcript for your entire video you should consider posting it in the description of your video in order to improve your search engine ranking. This can also help for users that would like to have a written article to accompany your video and for indexing your video in search engine results. There are so many people that don't make proper use of their video descriptions on YouTube that doing so will give you an advantage.

## 4\. Write Searchable YouTube Video Tiles

By including your 1 or 2 most important keywords in the title of your video you will help YouTube sort your video into the correct search results. Generally, your most important keywords will be things like the name of the game you’re playing or the brand of makeup you’re reviewing.

Try to write titles that are searchable and which also get potential viewers excited about your content. Do not try to be mysterious or clickbait-y in your video title. Big channels can be very successful with those strategies because they’re already guaranteed a certain number of views, but this will almost always backfire for small channels.

Phrases such as ‘review’, ‘how-to’, and ‘tutorial’ get searched for a lot, so always include them in your titles when they apply to your videos.

## 5\. Optimize your Video Description for YouTube SEO

Video descriptions should generally include around 4000 characters (about 900 words) in which you describe the content of your YouTube video, include important keywords, provide links to your other social media accounts, and ask viewers to subscribe. Using up all the space in your description is a good way to ensure you’re getting the maximum search value out of it.

If you use a lot of products in your videos (i.e. you make cooking videos, so your favorite frying pan is in a lot of shots) then it is a good idea to look into affiliate programs. Amazon has one of the best. If you become an affiliate you can post links to the products you use in your video description and, if a viewer follows one and buys something (even if it’s not the thing you liked to) you’ll earn a commission. This won’t help you with search rankings, but it’s a nice bonus.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 6\. Use Custom Video Thumbnails

A [custom thumbnail](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is an excellent way to make your videos stand out ([check out these awesome thumbnail makers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)). A good thumbnail is its own piece of quality, customized, visual content that has the power to draw in audiences from search engine results. Make sure to take thumbnail-specific photos and perfect those images with text and graphics in Photoshop or a free alternative like Canva.

Custom thumbnails come with new metadata for your video and they can often be indexed in Google image searches along with the video content that you create. This means that you will have access to a text search via Google (your video title and description), video searches via Google, a video search via YouTube, and an image search via Google too.

In order to [create a thumbnail that stands out](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and attracts more views, you should first search for your video’s title on YouTube and see what kinds of thumbnails come up. You want your thumbnail to be enough like the results that viewers recognize it as being on the same topic, and different enough that it doesn’t fade into the crowd (a good strategy is to use a splash of color the other creators haven’t included).

If you are interested in generating more traffic to any YouTube video be sure to follow these 6 steps for how to get your YouTube video seen (and check out [4 more here!](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)).
