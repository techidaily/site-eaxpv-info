## What Is YouTube Studio?

YouTube Studio is a free, cloud-based video production software. It's the ideal way to create, distribute, and measure the overall success of your films on YouTube, Google+, and the web. It provides powerful editing tools, real-time feedback on how your films are performing, and one-click posting from your PC or smartphone. YouTube Studio provides several features:

#### 1\. Manages Multiple Channels

YouTube Studio makes managing a couple of channels a lot easier. You can see all of your channels on one screen and switch from one to the other without difficulty. Simply select Manage Channels from the account icon in the top right corner. When you have a lot of money owing to you, you can modify it.

#### 2\. Get Real-Time Data On Your Channels
