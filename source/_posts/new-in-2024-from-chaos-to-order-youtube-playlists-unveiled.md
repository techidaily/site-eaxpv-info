## Difference between a Channel and a Playlist on YouTube

There are times where one gets confused with the YouTube channels and playlists. While some say they are similar, the fact is both are different. A person with a specific name creates a channel, and it is the place where the person posts all the videos or uploads them for his/her subscribers to get likes and more audience.

![What is YouTube Channel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-youtube-channel.jpg)

But YouTube playlists are auto-generated contents that consist of videos from different channels but with the same content concept. For example, a PewDiePie channel will have his uploaded videos. Still, PewDiePie playlists will have all his videos and the ones similar to his stream but off the channel. Likewise, self-created playlists will have videos that you have saved to see them later or often.

When your video comes under a theme and is categorized, the YouTube algorithm places it over with the other related to each other. The next time, your video will appear on the right sidebar below the "related videos." As the video plays automatically, one after the other, the number of views increases. "Amazing playlists can make viewers watch it longer!"

## Final Words

Overall, Ryan Kaji saw great success with his stunning and engaging videos on his YouTube channel over the years. Also, he focused on other ventures, with the support of the team behind his channel, for income and editing work.

But, while starting, your funding will be less. It would help if you handled the video editing work on your own first, with reliable software like [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Also, use other analytics tools and strategies to improve your channel further.
