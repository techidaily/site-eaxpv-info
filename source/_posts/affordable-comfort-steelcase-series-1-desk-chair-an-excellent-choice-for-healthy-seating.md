## Affordable Comfort: Steelcase Series 1 Desk Chair - An Excellent Choice for Healthy Seating

### Key Takeaways

* The Steelcase Series 1's ergonomic design supports comfortable sitting all day.
* The chair also supports people of all sizes, even with its lightweight (yet sturdy) construction.
* The optional headrest might not be worth the extra cost, and the armrest could be improved.

 Like most office workers, I spend too many hours sitting every day. Although I have a standing desk, I don't use it as often as I should. After testing the [Steelcase Series 1](https://amazon.com/dp/B078HG8HWF?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteelcase-series-1-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) for over a month, my only regret is not getting rid of my gaming chair sooner and swapping it out with an ergonomic option.

##  A Well-Constructed and Comfortable Office Chair

Close 

 The Steelcase Series 1 comes in four pieces, not including the optional headrest, and it was one of the easiest pieces of furniture to construct. The back piece comes attached to the armrest and base, which is placed on top of the wheels and cylinder. After that, you only need to slide on the seat and sit down. Adjust the chair's height, armrests, and seat position, and you're done.

 At first glance, I didn't think this chair was truly as universal as the company claimed. It's extremely lightweight, most hard pieces are made of plastic, and it just doesn't look super sturdy. I was quickly proven wrong.

 Sitting in the chair, I immediately felt the ergonomic design fit my back and support my frame. Steelseries advertises the back design and lumbar support as the "LiveBack Flexor System." In practice, you lean back into a microknit mesh material supported by flexible plastic lines. The lumbar support resides in the bottom quarter of the design and can be adjusted up and down several inches. I kept this pretty low to help support my back, which felt fantastic.

 The seat consists of an upholstery-wrapped piece of foam that doesn't look very thick but had no problem supporting me for hours, and I never felt uncomfortable. Even better, I've been sitting in this chair for over a month and have yet to see any wear or deformation in the seat's foam cushion. At this rate, I'm confident it'll continue to retain its shape and feel comfortable for at least the next year.

 Finally, let's talk about the controls. There aren't many, but this simplicity was welcome. In addition to the switch that lets you slide the seat forward and back, there is a knob that works double-duty. There's the standard lever that raises and lowers the Series 1, but twisting the knob lets you lock the chair into an upright position, allow full motion, or introduce a small amount of resistance while leaning back. The compact package works really well.

##  My Biggest Issue Is With the Armrest

Close 

 You have three armrest options: 4-way adjustable arms, height adjustable only, and armless. The 4-way adjustable arms are the default option, but you can choose one of the two other choices and save a few bucks.

 My review unit came with the 4-way adjustable arms, and while they were comfortable, I felt like I was always battling them. The height of the armrests can be locked in place, and you can change it by holding down a button found on the bottom of the armrest. The top part of the armrest floats, allowing you to adjust the width, depth, and pivot.

 My issue is that you can move the top portion of the armrest into the most comfortable position, but the moment you shift your weight or lean on that piece of plastic, the entire area moves. I eventually got used to readjusting the arms every time I moved or stood up, but it'd be really nice if these also locked in place.

 Ultimately, I'd still recommend the 4-way adjustable arms over the other two options. They offer the most flexibility and comfort, even though you must constantly shift them back into place.

##  I Could Take or Leave the Headrest

Close 

 The optional headrest is an $80 accessory, so I was really hoping it would be worth the extra cost. In practice, though, I didn't find it all that useful.

 Due to its position, my head never touched the Series 1's headrest unless I was lying back. Sitting upright, I was always several inches away. It was comfortable when I needed a break and wanted to lean back, but it never supported my head at other points during the day.

 Installing the headrest was fairly easy, but Steelcase doesn't tell you that you'll need a [T20 Torx screwdriver](https://www.amazon.com/Torx-T20-screwdriver/s?k=Torx+T20+screwdriver&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteelcase-series-1-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) during the purchase process. The pre-installed screws and the longer screws that come with the headrest require the security bit, but the chair doesn't include any tools. So, if you don't already have the screwdriver, you'll need to hit up your local hardware store and purchase one.

 It's also worth noting that the plastic back on my headrest showed up dirty. It was easy enough to clean, but since the headrest was shipped in packaging separate from the rest of the chair, it had to have gotten messy in the company's factory or warehouse. I'm hoping this was just a fluke.

##  Should You Buy the Steelcase Series 1?

 If you are in the market for a new office chair, the [Steelcase Series 1](http://amazon.com/dp/B078HG8HWF?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002886&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteelcase-series-1-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) is a great option. It's comfortable, should fit most people, and is relatively inexpensive. $500 isn't nothing, but if you're sitting in this chair for most of your day, it's worth the investment.
