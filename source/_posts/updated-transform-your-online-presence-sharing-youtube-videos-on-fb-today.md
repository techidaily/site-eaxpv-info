#### 1 Import Files to Audio Converter

 Before upload MP3 to YouTube, you can collect the relevant image, album cover or band picture to your music. Then run this MP3 to YouTube converter and choose 16:9 or 4:3 ratio according to your needs. After that, click “Import” to add the MP3 file and the pictures to the program. Then all the imported files will be displayed as thumbnails in the Media library.

#### 2 Add Pictures to MP3 Files

 Drag and drop your MP3 file to the music layer, and the picture to the video layer. These will be located under the timeline bar. Then choose the picture and move your mouse to expand the picture exposure time frame exactly as long as your MP3 file. If less, the remaining part will be blacked out, while too long will create silence in the overextended portions of the video.

 If you want to add and show multiple pictures at a time for a single MP3 file, drag-n-drop them to the PIP layers. This MP3 to YouTube converter supports up to 10 pictures for the same MP3 file. Then adjust the position and size of each picture. You can also do more touch up to your creation. For example, you can right click and choose edit to add motion, mask and more effects as you like.
