**How to make a parody video?**

If you want to know **how to make a parody video** then follow the below steps:

* **Finding the perfect song:**
* **Getting the correct music:** To get the right music, Youtube will be a suitable platform.
* **Recording suitable lyrics:** The lyrics can be recorded with the help of a microphone in-built with computers. In the absence of a microphone, a video camera will do the work as a substitute. The operating system running under Windows will give the option of Windows movie maker as the recording tool. GarageBand and iMovie will serve the purpose if the user has a Mac operating device. The ultimate goal is a smooth recording. The area of the recording should be soundproof or should have minimum external noise interference. The professional studios have soundproof walls of the rooms for recording. But this is not the case here. Any quiet place is sufficiently suitable for the recording. The pitch and quality of the voice must not be too rough or too fast. Practicing for a few cycles before the final recording will be perfect.
* **Making a music video:** The newly created parody will get the maximum benefit if it collaborates with a music video. Only with the help of a video camera, the filming can be done. There should be proper sync between the music video and the parody. Before filming everything should be planned. The location of the shoot should be confirmed beforehand. The background should meet the theme of the song and parody. It is required to carry all the costumes and props to the location of the shoot. Once the video is shot, now it is time for attaching the two clips to make a single impactful video. Use powerful video editing tools to get what you want- Filmora can help you make it.
