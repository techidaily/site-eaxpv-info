Playing a video game is a thrilling experience because it makes us feel the joys of winning and the sorrows of losing. But, the main reason why gaming has become so popular is that it offers entertainment unlike any other. The development of broadcasting and screen capturing software has made sharing gaming videos online possible, and in a little over a decade of YouTube's existence, the platform is one of the best sources of gaming videos of all types.

Gaming YouTube channels, such as Jacksepticeye or Vanoss Gaming have millions of subscribers which makes them quite influential. So in this article, we will take a look at some of the top gaming YouTubers and rank them based on their popularity and the number of subscribers their channels have.

His CaptainSparklez channel has over 10 million subscribers, while his other YouTube channels Maron Music, Jordan Maron, and CaptainSparklez2 have significantly fewer subscribers. Jordan often produces Minecraft-themed music video parodies, but in recent years he has also been creating original music for these videos. In 2015 he appeared as CaptainSparklez in the TV series Gamer's Guide to Pretty Much Everything and the following year he made an appearance on the Bad Internet TV series.

#### 6. [The Game Theorists \[Matthew Patrick\]](https://www.youtube.com/user/MatthewPatrick13)

Unlike most top gaming YouTubers, Matthew Patrick the man behind this brilliant channel is more focused on education and cultural aspects of video games. As the channel's name suggests videos often feature several hosts that speak about different aspects of games.

Even though Matthew Patrick's approach to gaming videos is somewhat unorthodox, his YouTube channel still has over 10 million subscribers. Since 2009, when the channel was initially created, The Game Theorists hosted a number of separate shows such as The SCIENCE or DeadLock. Some of the episodes of these shows are only available on channels hosted by other YouTubers, and you can find only a few episodes on The Game Theorists channel. Besides being a popular Internet personality, Matthew Patrick is also an accomplished writer, actor, and producer who graduated Summa Cum Laude from Duke University.

#### 7. [Game Grumps \[Ross O'Donovan\]](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9CuvdOVfMPvKCiwdGKL3cQ)

Currently, the Game Grumps YouTube channel has 4.5 million subscribers which makes it one of the most influential authorities on gaming.

Most episodes feature two hosts playing a video game, while commenting on the gameplay, stating their opinions, and often talking about unrelated subjects. The web series doesn't cover a particular gaming genre, and most games the hosts play on the show are suggested by fans. The channel features special holiday-themed episodes that cover holiday editions of video games. Also in some episodes, Arin and Dan play the games alone, even though they frequently have guests on the show.

#### 8. [I AM WILDCAT \[Tyler Wine\]](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-kOXc3gBwksVfmndSEz7jg)

Since 2011, when this popular gaming channel was created, it has amassed 6.2 million subscribers and over a billion total views. The 26-year old Indiana-based YouTuber named Tyler Wine became popular for his distinctive commentating style which often includes humor and sometimes even cursing.

In the early days of his career as a YouTube commentator, Tyler was mostly producing videos centered around Call of Duty but as he was securing his place among the top gaming YouTubers his videos started featuring Fortnite, Grand Theft Auto, or Garry's Mode. Tyler has been uploading LetsPlay videos since 2012 to his [WILDCATLetPlays](https://www.youtube.com/user/WILDCATLetsPlays/featured) channel that currently has a little over 200.000 subscribers. He uploaded videos to his channels weekly or once every two weeks in the past, but now he uploads videos to YouTube almost every day.

#### 9. [H20Delirious \[Jonathan Smith\]](https://www.youtube.com/user/H2ODelirious)

The man behind the H20Delirious channel has managed to remain anonymous for more than a decade. This LetsPlay gaming channel was created in May 2007 and since then the channel's owner has identified himself as just Jonathon. He even released prank videos in 2015 and 2017 in which he pretended to reveal his true identity.

However, Jonathon is a part of the VanossGaming crew and his H20Delirious channel has over 10 million subscribers which easily places him among the top gaming YouTubers. He creates LetsPlay videos for popular games like Fallout 4, Hitman, Fortnite, or Grand Theft Auto. The 31-old American's trademark is his psychotic laughter and he is probably the owner of one of the oldest gaming channels on YouTube.

#### 10. [PopularMMOs](https://www.youtube.com/user/PopularMMOs/featured)

With more than 14 million subscribers and a net worth of approximately $7 million Patrick Brown, the guy who runs the PopularMMOs channel is one of the most successful gaming YouTubers.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Working hard to produce exciting, informative and beautiful YouTube videos only to miss out on the exposure you’re hoping for can be very demoralizing, and many people give up the practice of video production after failing to generate interest in their work.

However, don’t accept defeat just yet if you’re not quite getting the numbers you’ve been aiming for. Take these steps to if you need to get subscribers for YouTube videos. Read on to find out more about the best ways to attract new YouTube subscribers for your online video channel.

* [**Part 1: How to Get More Subscribers on YouTube for Beginners**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: How to Get More Subscribers on YouTube for Pros**](#part2)
* [**Part 3: How to Get Free YouTube Subscribers \[With Proven Methods\]** ](#part3)

## Part 1: How to Get More Subscribers on YouTube for Beginners

### 1. Be Real and Approachable

You should always be yourself when you vlog. People will subscribe when they feel invested in you as a person, and that happens when they feel like you are being sincere. You do not need to share all of your innermost secrets on your vlog, but you should let your viewers feel like they know you.

### 2. Don’t forget to add a call to action

Some people need to be prompted to subscribe to your channel, no matter how much they enjoy your content. At the end of all your videos, ask your viewers to subscribe to your channel and like your social media page.

Don’t forget to explain the benefits of subscribing to them, such as to benefit from your informative tips and gain a deeper insight into your projects. If you have any interesting videos in the pipeline, let them know about them.

![call to action](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-to-action-video.JPG)

### 3. Listen To Your Subscribers

It feels nice to get positive comments on your videos. If people feel comfortable enough to leave you suggestions and requests then that is even better. It means that you have succeeded in making them feel like they are part of your community.

If you get a video request, try to do it. People like to feel that you are open to trying the things they want to see. However, there are also times when you should just ignore requests and suggestions. If the majority of your subscribers enjoy your jokes and you get one comment telling you to stop trying to be funny then it is fairly obvious that that ‘suggestion’ does not really reflect the wishes of your community.

![get subscriber](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subscriber02.JPG)

### 4. Optimize your title

Try not to underestimate the importance of a great eye-catching title. Include relevant words and phrases that you think people will search for and don’t just hastily add the first title that comes into your head. The better your title is, the more viewers and subscribers you are likely to amass.

![title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/optimize-title.JPG)

### 5. Be Patient

Almost all vlogs grow slowly at first; the first 1000 subscribers take the longest to get. It takes a lot of patience to keep producing content on a regular schedule when it seems like not many people are watching, but you need to stick with it in order to grow.

## Part 2: How to Get more Subscribers on YouTube for Pros

### 1. Set goals

You can gain extra drive and momentum by setting yourself attainable goals and encouraging your followers to help you achieve them. These goals can include milestones such as reaching 500 followers, 1,000 followers and so on. Don’t hesitate to tell your viewers about these goals – if they think your content is of real value, chances are they will be only too happy to assist you.

![goals](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-goals.JPG)

### 2. Contests can be funny – why not enter one?

One way to increase subscribers is to take part in a contest. A site called Gleam can oversee a contest for you. It’s up to you to choose how you want the contest to work, and you can gain an edge over your competitors by getting people to leave comments, follow you on Instagram, subscribe to your channel and more.

You will be provided with a landing page for promoting your channel, and you can share this in a variety of places, including on your Facebook, Twitter and blog. The best way to heighten your chances of success is to have a clear goal in mind.

![video0 contest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-contest.JPG)

### 3. Make a trailer

YouTube’s channel interface allows you to add a [trailer](https://www.fastcompany.com/3031012/9-short-storytelling-tips-from-a-master-of-movie-trailers) to entice viewers into watching your videos and following you on the platform. Your trailer gives you a valuable opportunity to quickly explain what your channel is all about and what the benefits of following you are.

Don’t waffle on – try to get your clip down to 90 seconds maximum. Include clips from your videos and don’t forget to add a strong call to action at the end. The more effort you put into your videos, the bigger the rewards are likely to become. And here are some of the [best trailer makers that you can use on both Windows and Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

![trailer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-killer-youtube-channel-trailer.jpg)

### 4. Make a Schedule and Stick To It

You want to vlog at least once a week, and making a schedule will help you keep on top of that. It will also give your subscribers a chance to anticipate your videos and get excited. They are more likely to watch an update they have been expecting than one that was not already on their minds.

Sticking to your schedule is a good wait to build up credibility with your audience, but late or skipped updates will cause you to lose that credibility. If you do not post for a month then people who already subscribed to you might still ignore your update because it has been too long and they forgot about you.

### 5. Collaborate With Other Vloggers

Collaboration videos are always big hits. When you collaborate with another vlogger you are essentially introducing each other to your subscribers. This is a great way to grow your community quickly: by connecting it to another community.

Collaborations work best when the other vlogger is located close enough to you that you can actually meet up, but you can do distance collaborations too. When you collaborate you and the other vlogger should have close to the same number of subscribers, so the video will benefit you both equally.

## Bonus: How to Get Free YouTube Subscribers \[6 Proven Methods\]

There are lots of ways to get free YouTube subscribers. This proven method involves networking with other creators! Making your presence felt on YouTube is an important part of creating your network of subscribers that watch, share and talk about your videos. Interaction with your subscribers, reaching new audiences every day, and a plethora of other factors influence how well your YouTube channel is doing.

In this part, we will show you how you can build your own network of loyal YouTube supporters and prove that you don't need the services of paid providers who promise better reach for your channel.

### 1. Find YouTubers in your niche

The first step to building an enviable army of YouTube subscribers starts with the realization that you are not alone. Regardless of the niche, your videos are covering, there are probably thousands of people who are just starting out or that have as many subscribers as your YouTube channel. Focus on finding them. You may even want to make a list.

### 2. Subscribe to YouTube channels you really like

Of the channels you found in Step 1, choose the ones you genuinely like and subscribe to them.

It goes without saying that everyone enjoys support, especially if you are not asking for anything in return. By subscribing to YouTube channels in your genre you appreciate, you will make yourself known to the channel's owner, and there is a chance they will check out and subscribe to your channel.

### 3. Spend time watching videos each day

Knowledge is power and, if you want to attract real people to your channel, you should learn how to use your knowledge to your advantage. By paying attention to other new videos in your genre you’ll gain insight into what is going over well with audiences like yours, and what isn’t.

Also, be especially sure to watch videos from those channels you found in Step 1 and subscribed to in Step 2\. Try to watch at least two minutes of content from those channels whenever they upload.

### 4. Comment thoughtfully. Don’t ask for anything in return

Most YouTubers are delighted to hear someone else's positive opinion or constructive criticism regarding their work. The reason you are watching 2 minutes of content per video in Step 3 is so that you will really have something to say in this step.

If you do make a thoughtful comment, and especially if you use the time stamp of the part of the video you’re referring to, the video creator will know you have watched the video and that you are not just another spammer. Avoid the sub-4-sub strategy, and don't be the person who's always saying 'Subscribe to my channel'. You will be ignored by both the creator and other viewers, and the creator will find you annoying. However, if you comment regularly without asking for anything, the creator and some of their viewers will naturally decide to check out your channel.

### 5. Reach out on social media

YouTube is just one out of many channels through which you can reach like-minded people. Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest or any other social network can help you network with other creators and potential subscribers. Create accounts on social networks you find the most suitable for your video category and share links to your videos on these accounts as often as you can. Furthermore, if you try to foster real discussions about topics that are relevant, people who get to know you through these other platforms will probably decide to check out your YouTube channel.

Social media is also a great place to reach out to other creators, whether it’s for collabs or just to chat about doing YouTube.

### 6. Do it all again. And again. And again

You aren’t going to see great results overnight. You have to spend time almost every day repeating the steps we just described. This might seem intimidating, but as time passes it will become routine.

When you build your presence on YouTube in this way, other creators and their subscribers will naturally start becoming your subscribers. What's your best tip for free YouTube subscribers?

**Conclusion**

Some people might need to watch multiple videos by you before they decide they want to subscribe. If you stop making videos because you did not get any subscribers or comments on your first few then chances are there were people who were paying attention who may have subscribed if you had kept at it.
