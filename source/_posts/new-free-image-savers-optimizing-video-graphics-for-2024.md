Select the media clip in the Timeline and click the **Speed** icon as explained in the previous step. From the menu that appears, click **Custom Speed** this time. When the **Custom Speed** box appears, use the **Speed** slider to adjust the playback speed of the media clip, and check the **Reverse** box to **reverse YouTube video**. Optionally, you can also modify the **Duration** and **Ripple** options to customize the preferences. Finally, click **OK** to save the changes.

### 4. Export the Video or Upload to YouTube Directly

Back on the main window, click **EXPORT** from the top. Filmora provides several ways to saving and sharing the video.

Or, go to the YouTube tab and sign in your YouTube account to upload the reversed video to YouTube directly. In the YouTube upload interface, you can optimize the [YouTube SEO](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) elements and revise the video title, description, category and tags.

**Conclusion**

Even though the online video reversers are free and offer simple process to get the job done, the desktop programs like Wondershare Filmora offer more flexibility when it comes to making changes to the media clips, controlling the playback speed, adding effects, applying the modifications only to certain sections of the footage, selecting output preferences, etc. before you can **reverse YouTube video**.
