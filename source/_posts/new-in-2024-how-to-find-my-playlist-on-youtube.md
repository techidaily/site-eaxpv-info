The YouTube video player has an aspect ratio of 16:9, so it adds vertical black bars to fit according to the dimension. And in this guide, we will help you get rid of this trouble and remove annoying black bars from YouTube videos.

 **yt:crop=16:9**

 This tag zooms in on the video because of which the contents at the borders (black bars in this case) do not appear anymore.

 **yt:stretch=16:9**

 This tag stretches the video in the aspect ratio of 16:9\. It is used to view the video in wide-screen format.
