## Q1\. Can I Customize YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?

Yes, you can. YouTube did allow short-form video creators to upload custom thumbnails for their Shorts. However, they aren't that optimized. For instance, some people may not see them on the Shorts shelf. Also, if you share a link to the video somewhere else, the old video thumbnail may show instead of the new one.

Adding a custom thumbnail for YouTube Shorts is the same as adding one for long-form videos on the platform. Follow these steps:

* Open the YouTube mobile app. Click the "Plus" icon at the bottom center > "Create Short." Upload, edit, and post your video.

* Get to your desktop computer or laptop. Open your channel's YouTube Studio.

* On the left navigation menu, click "Content."

![content section on youtube studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-3.JPG)

* Click the "pencil" icon next to the Shorts you just uploaded. This video should be at the top of the list.
* Navigate to the Thumbnail section. Click "Create Thumbnail."

## Q2\. Why Are YouTube Shorts Thumbnails Not Showing?

It's not you who's the only one with Shorts thumbnails not showing. Many short-form content creators on the platform are also facing this issue. A YouTuber took to Reddit to complain about how he uploaded custom thumbnails for all his videos. The thumbnails are correct in the editor. However, YouTube still displays a random frame as the thumbnail on the Shorts shelf.

_"They ALL have randomly selected different parts of each video I have uploaded & somehow generated a new/unknown thumbnail that was neither what I uploaded as the custom option nor 1 of the 3 that YouTube auto populated."_

[YouTuber on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/v51d93/youtube%5Fshorts%5Fthumbnails%5Fnot%5Fappearing%5Fcorrectly/)

The reason behind this is the difference in the thumbnail size. Regular YouTube video thumbnails are in the ratio of 16:9\. Meanwhile, Shorts uses a ratio of 9:16\. The thing is that YouTube does not yet allow you to upload 9:16 thumbnails. Thus, the thumbnail for Shorts may show correctly on the video section but not on the Shorts shelf.

![fix youtube shorts thumbnail not showing problem](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fix-youtube-shorts-thumbnail-not-showing.JPG)

Unfortunately, there is no reliable fix to this problem yet. YouTubers have tried different things in hopes that YouTube will display the correct thumbnail for their Shorts.

Some YouTubers have tried using different images. Others have experimented with changing the aspect ratio of the thumbnail or using Adobe editor for ratios. Clearing histories and cache, using different browsers, resizing, and changing the images' resolution have also been done. Sadly, these are all failed attempts.

## Q4\. How To Boost Views When I Have no Control Over YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?

Attracting viewers on Shorts is the same as attracting viewers on the main YouTube. You use interesting thumbnails and video titles. Since thumbnails are out of the options, selecting great video titles has become even more important.

Here are some pointers. Your title should be at most 40 characters. Also, it should be concise and irresistible. And forget about SEO since no one is searching for YouTube Shorts anyway. People consume what they see in their feeds. So instead, the title should be "snappy." It should intrigue, entertain, or enlighten the viewers. That will net you some views for your Shorts content.

## Q5\. How To Get More Views on YouTube Shorts?

Forgoing the intro is the way to go. An intro will just prolong the video when people are in Shorts to find bite-sized videos. So jump right into the video content. You can also start the video with a still frame instead. Using hashtags, captions, and text effects are also recommended. And interacting with your audience through comments and pinned comments will keep them coming back to your Shorts channel.

Of course, ensuring that the video quality is high is key to getting more views. For that, you need a good video editor. You can try [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), a powerful and easy-to-use video editor.

## Best YouTube Vlog Hashtags

Hashtags are powerful features that can connect the right viewer to your content. They merge videos and viewers with similar topics and interests.

If you have a vlog on YouTube, there is a set of hashtags that work perfectly with this type of content.

This is a list that might help:

* #vloggingmylife
* #vlogginggear
* #vloggerlife
* #vloggers
* #vloglife
* #vlogger
* #vlogging
* #youtuber
* #vlogs
* #dailyvlog
* #vloggingcamera
* #vloging
* #vloggingcommunity
* #vloggerlifestyle
* #travelvlogging
* #vloggingmum
* #foodvlogging
* #vlogginglife
* #newtovlogging
* #disneyvlogging
* #vlogging101
* #vloggingsetup
* #vloggingfamily
* #vlogday
* #kidsvlogging
* #imvlogginghere
* #beautyvlogging
* #microvlogging
* #motovlogging
* #instavlogging

When using hashtags for YouTube, it's essential to put yourself in your viewers' shoes. So first, ask yourself what your ideal viewer is searching for.

For example, if you’re creating a video on how to cook past, think about all the ways the viewer would search for this on YouTube. A few hashtags may come to mind are #pastarecipes, #pastacooking, #tasypasta, and so on. I hope you get the idea of how hashtags work.

This may take a lot of time. However, a YouTube hashtag generator can make this process a lot quicker and even more effective.

## Best Tools for YouTube Vlog Hashtags

You should know that more than these thirty hashtags will be needed to help your videos succeed. But sometimes, you will need better or more appropriate ones.

The best way to always have the perfect tags is to use a YouTube hashtags generator. It's a tool that digs up the ideal tags for every type of video.

## Conclusion

Finding the best hashtags for YouTube is an easy but also important task. It's all the little things combined that help you get more viewers. Things like using the right keywords, thumbnails, YouTube tags, etc.

Yet, it would help if you didn't forget the most important thing: the video itself. So, give Filmora a try and become surprised by how easy it is to create a high-quality YouTube video.

Best YouTube Vlog Hashtags

Hashtags are powerful features that can connect the right viewer to your content. They merge videos and viewers with similar topics and interests.

If you have a vlog on YouTube, there is a set of hashtags that work perfectly with this type of content.

This is a list that might help:

* #vloggingmylife
* #vlogginggear
* #vloggerlife
* #vloggers
* #vloglife
* #vlogger
* #vlogging
* #youtuber
* #vlogs
* #dailyvlog
* #vloggingcamera
* #vloging
* #vloggingcommunity
* #vloggerlifestyle
* #travelvlogging
* #vloggingmum
* #foodvlogging
* #vlogginglife
* #newtovlogging
* #disneyvlogging
* #vlogging101
* #vloggingsetup
* #vloggingfamily
* #vlogday
* #kidsvlogging
* #imvlogginghere
* #beautyvlogging
* #microvlogging
* #motovlogging
* #instavlogging

When using hashtags for YouTube, it's essential to put yourself in your viewers' shoes. So first, ask yourself what your ideal viewer is searching for.

For example, if you’re creating a video on how to cook past, think about all the ways the viewer would search for this on YouTube. A few hashtags may come to mind are #pastarecipes, #pastacooking, #tasypasta, and so on. I hope you get the idea of how hashtags work.

This may take a lot of time. However, a YouTube hashtag generator can make this process a lot quicker and even more effective.

## Best Tools for YouTube Vlog Hashtags

You should know that more than these thirty hashtags will be needed to help your videos succeed. But sometimes, you will need better or more appropriate ones.

The best way to always have the perfect tags is to use a YouTube hashtags generator. It's a tool that digs up the ideal tags for every type of video.

Here are the three best YouTube hashtag generators you can use:

### 1 Keyword Tool

This tool's primary purpose may be to help with keyword research, but it has a valuable hashtag extension.

First, type in the topic of your video. For example, "vlog." Hit Search.

![youtube hashtag generator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/youtube-keyword-tool.jpg)

Then, select the Hashtags panel.

![youtube hashtag tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/hashtag-panel.jpg)

This will show you a massive list of trending hashtags you can use for your YouTube video. However, the YouTube tags it gives you will sometimes be different. For example, if you search for the same word at another time, the results may differ depending on current trends.

That's all there is to it. Copy any tags you like and use them for your video. Also, you can purchase the pro version of this tool to get more detailed insights. However, the free version works just fine most of the time. The choice is yours.

### 2 TubeBuddy Chrome Extension
