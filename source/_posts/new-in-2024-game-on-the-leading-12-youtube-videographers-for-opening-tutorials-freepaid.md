It can easily handle processes like motion tracking, composition, rendering, simulation, animation, rigging and modeling etc. It may appear difficult for beginners to make a gaming intro with this free intro maker but professionals can definitely create wonders with this software tool.

#### 4\. Cinema 4D: $3510.5

This is a complete and complex software for 3D video animation, it's developed by MAXON Computer GmbH in Germany, and it gives you almost all the power and control over 3D design and creation. It is very expensive ($3510.5) and complex, so if you just want a simple and quick intro, we don't recommend this to you to make a simple gaming intro.
