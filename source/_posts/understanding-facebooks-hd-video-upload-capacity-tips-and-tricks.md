Unlike other video sharing sites, FaceBook provides you with some leeway as far as **FaceBook video size limit** is concerned. For the most part, FaceBook allows you to upload video with **1GB** in size and **20 mins** in length. And the max FaceBook video size is up to **1.75GB** (**45 mins** for duration limit), but it's quite a patience-demanding task for uploading such a large video file to FaceBook.

Actually, according to the authoritative report, most people tend to view online videos for 25 to 50 seconds. After that, their concentration often starts to drift and they lose interest so as to give up watching. Thus, uploading a long video to FaceBook is pointless if viewers miss the highlights after several raw footages. 

Hence, if you plan to upload a long video to FaceBook, it's advisable to [convert Facebook video to MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) of smaller size than other formats, cut the video into several short clips (tutorial or documentary excl.) or trim the unwanted parts off video to let people watch the part you wanna present for them. Here the FaceBook video editing software - [**MacX Video Converter Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) can do you such a favor, letting you split video into a dozen more short videos as you like and cut off the unwanted segments from video so that you can faster & easier upload video to FaceBook and attract more viewers to see the highlights of the video.
