**Does YouTube have a trimmer?**

Yes, you may cut videos after they've been uploaded to the YouTube site. You may chop off the beginning, middle, or ending of your movie on a computer. It is not necessary to re-upload a video to cut it. The video's URL, view counts, and comments will remain unchanged. This functionality is only accessible for less than 6 hours long videos.

**What is the difference between cut and trim in video editing?**

Cutting is the process of separating pieces of a clip. You can reuse these portions in another video or delete them entirely. On the other hand, trimming is the process of eliminating or expanding the duration of a video clip's front or tail regions in video editing.

**Does YouTube have a trimmer?**

Yes, you may cut videos after they've been uploaded to the YouTube site. You may chop off the beginning, middle, or ending of your movie on a computer.
