#### #5 Add music to video

YouTube also allows you to swap out the audio with one of its licensed tracks. To do this, go back to the main interface of the editor and click the Audio tab. Then select a song from the library and either drag it to the soundtrack timeline or press the plus sign to the right of each title.

![youtube video editor tip](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/add-music-youtube.jpg)

Note: You should note that some are songs are subject to licensing agreements, which means YouTube will automatically add advertisements to the video clip.

Another short coming is that you can't edit the audio track at all. If a song is longer than your video, you can do nothing but let it play from the beginning until your video stops.

#### #6 Add transitions to video

If several video clips have been added to the timeline, you need transition to make the whole project smoother. To add transition, go to the Transition tab and choose from 16 transition effects.

YouTube Video Editor is really easy to use, but it only provides some basic video editing functions and is really easy to crash when dealing with large file. If you want to make your video more professional, try [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
