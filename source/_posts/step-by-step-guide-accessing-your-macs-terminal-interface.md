##  How to Open Terminal from Your Applications Folder

 If you'd prefer to go launch Terminal from the program icon in Finder, you'll usually find it located in the /Applications/Utilities folder. This is its default location on fresh installations of macOS.

 To open Terminal from your Applications folder, click your desktop to bring Finder into focus. In the menu bar, click "Go" and select "Applications."

 Your Applications folder will open. Scroll through until you find the "Utilities" folder. Double-click the "Utilities" folder to open it.

##  Keep the Terminal in Your Dock for Faster Access

 After launching Terminal, if you'd like to quickly access it again in the future, you can choose to keep its icon in your Dock. Just right-click the Terminal icon on your Dock and select "Options > Keep in Dock." The next time you need to run Terminal, just click its Dock icon. Have fun on the command line!

![Right-click Terminal on the Dock, go to 'Options,' then click 'Keep in Dock.'](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/click-keep-in-dock.png) 

 Starting with macOS Catalina, the default command-line shell is [Zsh](https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2023s-elite-web-based-recording-devices-for-2024/), but you can [switch back to the Bash shell](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-quickcapture-pro-efficient-win11-video-recorder/) if you prefer it.
