### Why Need to Convert SWF to MOV on macOS?

**Reasons:** In spite of the fact that SWF file has many advantages including easy graphics scaling, fast loading, small size, smooth compression and transparency support, the Achilles heel of the SWF files is its poor compatibility which prevents you playing or editing a SWF file unless Adobe Flash Player, a browser plugin or a standalone player has been installed on your computer. SWF animation also fails to open on any iDevice (iPhone, iPad, etc) which enforces numerous iDevice users to turn their back on files in this format. 

**Solution:** MOV format, developed by Apple, is the primary video format used for saving movies and other video files which is compatible with both Macintosh and Windows platforms. Also, the MOV format is default format of Mac OS X and works perfectly well with Apple devices (iMovie, iTunes, QuickTime Player, iPhone, iPad, Final Cut Pro, etc). Converting SWF files to MOV on mac thus seems to be a good alternative.
