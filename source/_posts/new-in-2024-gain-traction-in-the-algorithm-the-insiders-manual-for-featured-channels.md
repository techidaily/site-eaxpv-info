It is now possible to convert YouTube videos into GIFs by using the 5SecondsApp available for iOS. To make this possible you just require few things in your iPhone – the device should be iOS 11 or more, YouTube in the browser or app, and the 5SecondsApp already available in the App store.

First, you need to find a video that is not more than 10 seconds then begin the screen recording on the iOS recording feature and go back to YouTube to play the video and record the portion you need. To make the GIF you have to launch the app and tap the plus option there. Later, trim the video as you see fit. After you’re done, crop the video with the help of the crop tool and finally save it.
