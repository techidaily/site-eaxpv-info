## 4\. Alison: Introduction to Digital Photography

The principles of good photography are very similar to videography. Understanding how to frame a shot, how a camera functions, and what each feature on the camera does will give you more confidence as you begin to make more videos and gain experience.

The course features 13 modules, teaching the history, technical elements, and file formats of photography. Following the modules, there is an assessment where you can test all that you have learned.

## 5\. Hootsuite: Social Marketing Training

In this free social media course from Hootsuite, you will learn the benefits of spreading your message across multiple social media platforms and increasing the reach of your brand. All you need to do is sign up for a free account to access the material.

As you start making videos for YouTube, you will discover that one of the best ways of sharing them is on social media. The thing is creating content on YouTube is different from Facebook, Twitter, and other channels. Understanding the native content of each platform, the behavior of the audience, and how to best optimize and schedule content on other channels will ensure that you not only get views to your YouTube video but build a lasting fanbase.

## 6\. Moz: SEO Training Course

At the start, one of the most effective ways for your videos to get discovered is through search. Moz, a search engine optimization (SEO) tool, compiled all their instructional videos together for this course, in order to teach you all the basics of how Google determines whether to show your content as number one in the search result page or bury it deep in the basement where it will never see the light of day.

Understanding the fundamentals of SEO will put you leaps and bounds ahead of other YouTubers who are merely creating content out of random ideas they pluck from their heads.
