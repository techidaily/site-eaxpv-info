We know how painful it is when **Handbrake stops encoding videos and DVDs**. You get a 16GB game capture video in MP4 and wanna make this video smaller with Handbrake, but what makes you disappointed is that Handbrake won't start encoding this MP4 file. Still, you utilize Handbrake to convert MKV with soft subtitles to MP4\. However, the MP4 video with subtitles becomes shorter in video duration, from 25 mins to 17 mins on accounts of Handbrake incomplete encoding. In other cases, you import a commercial DVD disc to Handbrake for ripping DVD to H264/MKV, but sorry to find that your output video file is 2 seconds of nothing. There are even more Handbrake encoding problems, like Handbrake 1.0.7 crashing at starting when encoding, Handbrake 1.0.7 hangs during DVD scanning process, Handbrake stuck at 100%, Handbrake only encodes half movie, Handbrake error 4 or error 3, etc. 

Faced with such annoying problems, you need to calm down and figure out the potential reasons and solutions. If you have tried your best but still been trapped by these Handbrake errors, you're suggested to spend a few mins to look the below post, which sheds light on the potential reasons and provides the effective solutions for your reference. We will be very glad if these solutions work for you.

## Part 1 - Simple Solutions to Handbrake Stops Encoding Problem

As a Handbrake fan, I know it doesn't go wrong frequently, especially converting video. If Handbrake stops encoding at 10%, 18.26%, 20% or 50% for video conversion, you need to cool down and exert your efforts to fix Handbrake encode failed/Handbrake 1.0.7 crashed problem. I know, you may be a new hand, having no enough professional knowledge about Handbrake or video converter software, but at least Handbrake deserves your some time and energy to normalize it. Do you agree? If yes, then you can follow the below tips to try. If no, you can directly give up Handbrake and resort to a solid [Handbrake alternative](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) to finish your video encoding tasks. Ok, nonsense aside, let's back on track. 

● **Uninstall and reinstall Handbrake**. 

 ● **Try a Nightly Builds of Handbrake.** Nightly Builds are based on the latest development code and builds of the software that is not really released to the public. They are better suited for more experienced users and developers with 64-bit operating system and Mac OS X 10.7 or higher. 

 ● **Turn off OpenCL resizer.** It might be related with OpenCL resizer. Therefore, close OpenCL resizer under video settings. Or instead, try the above nightly build (OpenCL resizer has been excluded from nightly build). 

● **Properly Use Multi-core CPU**. If your computer is armed with Intel Core i9, i7 or i5, you're advised to assign 6, 4 or 2 CPU cores to accomplish the video conversion task with Handbrake instead of all the CPU cores.

● **Set the Large Files Switch**. To [convert large video file](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) (bigger than 4GB), you're supposed to check the Activity Log on Handbrake interface and set the Large Files Switch.

![Handbrake encode failed](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/handbrake-encode-failed.jpg)

● **Check the Motherboard Driver Updates** (BIOS updates included). 

 ● **Uninstall AMD APP on Your Windows or Linux**. The latest Handbrake 1.0.7 supports OpenCL, which will conflict with another OpenCL built in the AMD APP if you have installed on your Windows. So uninstall AMD APP from your computer to have a test.

● **Improve Your Hardware Equipment**. The lower-end computers are more likely to cause software like Handbrake encoding failed (error 4/3). Thus, give yourself a new improved computer if you afford.

![Handbrake not encoding DVD](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/1011-to-1012.jpg)

● **Make clear your DVD is copyright protected or not**. Everyone knows that Handbrake can't rip copyright protected DVDs and even the latest Handbrake 1.0.0 unless you installed the 3rd party software to help it. Even though, it still has no power to rip latest encrypted commercial DVDs. So if you use Handbrake to [rip encrypted DVDs](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), it's no wonder that you receive the error message "DVD has bad section", meet Handbrake won't start encoding or DVD encoding only 50% with disorder.

● **There is enough hard drive space or not**. We know the DVD movie is usually large in size, up to 4GB or larger. If your selected drive for output files has no enough space, this might also lead to Handbrake encoding fail. 

● **Disable LibDVDNav**. on Handbrake. For certain encrypted DVD ripping, you can have a try on this solution: access to "Tools" → "Options" → "Advanced" → tick "Disable LibDVDNav. (libdvdread will be used instead)". After DVD ripping is done, switch it back. 

● **Check if DVD disc is damaged or IFO files are damaged**. Your DVD disc with a slight and unobvious damage might also cause Handbrake stuck or encoding fail. If your DVD disc is not in severe condition, then the DVD ripper can [copy damaged DVD](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).
