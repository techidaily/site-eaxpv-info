That said, the following sections teach you how to find your YouTube comments on a desktop or laptop computer, and also on a mobile device if you are a gadget freak.

## Part 1: How to Find All the Comments You’ve Posted on YouTube?

YouTube allows you to post comments on any video only if you are signed in to your Google account while browsing the streaming platform. Because of this, the portal is able to keep a record of your activities, thus enabling you to track all your comments, and take necessary action such as deleting or modifying them as required.

You can learn how to find all the comments you have posted on YouTube while using your preferred device by following the instructions given below:

### 2\. Find Your YouTube Comments on an iPhone

Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, the YouTube app for iOS doesn’t have the feature to view your comments history. However, there is a workaround where you can use a web browser on your smartphone to get this done. The process that is given below explains how to view your past YouTube comments on an iPhone:

**Step 1: Sign In to Your YouTube Account on an Internet Browser**

Launch your favorite web browser on your iPhone (Safari, the default one, is used here for illustration), go to <https://m.youtube.com>, tap the profile icon from the top-right corner, tap **Sign in** from the menu that appears, and follow the on-screen instructions to use your Google account credentials to sign in to YouTube.

**Step 2: Access the Desktop Version of YouTube**

Tap the **More Options** icon from the top-left corner of the browser, and then tap **Request Desktop Website** from the menu that appears to access the desktop version of YouTube on your iPhone.

### 3\. Find Your YouTube Comments on an Android Smartphone

As it is with iOS, the YouTube app for Android doesn’t allow you to view your comments history either. However, the workaround of using a web browser works pretty well on Android smartphones too, but with a few tweaks. The process of doing so is given below:

**Step 1: Use a Web Browser to Sign In to Your YouTube Account**

Launch **Google Chrome** on your Android smartphone (you can use any other web browser of your choice), and go to <https://m.youtube.com>. Notice how the interface automatically changes to the desktop version. **Note:** If the desktop version of the website isn’t visible, you can tap the **More** button (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner of the browser, and check the **Desktop site** box.

Next, tap **SIGN IN** from the top-right corner of the YouTube page, enter your Google account credentials in the box available on the **Sign in** screen, enter your password when prompted, and sign in to your YouTube account.

**Step 2: Choose a Web Browser (for Confirmation)**

When the confirmation box pops up at the bottom, choose your preferred web browser, and tap the frequency of its usage for accessing YouTube. For instance, choose **Chrome** and **Just once** to use **Google Chrome** to access YouTube only for this session.

**Step 3: View/Access Your Past YouTube Comments**

Once you are signed in to your account, tap the **Menu** icon from the top-left corner of the YouTube page, and tap **History** from the menu that appears. When the **History** page opens up, tap **Comments** from the right pane to view and/or access your past YouTube comments.

## Part 2: How to Find All YouTube Comments Your Channel Has Received?

If you own a YouTube channel and have posted several videos there, it is likely that you also have received a decent number of comments. Usually, these remarks are pretty helpful as they tell you how to improve your production quality, and what your audience prefers to watch in the future. Therefore, it is imperative to learn how to find all the comments that your YouTube channel has received, and the process given below explains exactly that:

### 1\. Find Your Channel’s YouTube Comments on a Desktop or Laptop Computer

You can use your favorite web browser on a PC to easily find all the comments that the videos on your YouTube channel have received as long as you are signed in to your Google account. The step-by-step instructions on how this can be done are given below:

**Step 1: Go to the Your videos Page**

Open your favorite Internet browser, go to <https://www.youtube.com>, and sign in to your YouTube account as explained in the previous sections. Next, click the **Menu** icon from the top-left corner of the YouTube homepage, and click **Your videos** from the menu that appears.

![Access  YouTube Your videos Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-your-videos-menu.jpg)

**Step 2: View the Comments**

Make sure that the **Uploads** tab is selected on the **Channel content** window, and check the number under the **Comments** column of each video to see how many comments that particular film has received. You can click the number for any video to view its comments.

![Find  YouTube Comments List](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-youtube-video-comments-list.jpg)

**Step 3: Hide or Hold a Comment for Approval**

Click the **More** icon from the right of the comment you want to moderate, and click **Hide user from channel** or **Always approve comments from this user** to hide the comments from the selected user or keep their comments on hold until you review and approve them respectively.

![Find  YouTube Comments List](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-up-specific-user-comment-moderation.jpg)

Note: To view all comments received on your YouTube channel, go to the Comments tab under YouTube Studio, and you will find all Channel comments & mentions.

### 2\. Find Your Channel’s YouTube Comments on a Mobile App

This process is comparatively simpler than the previous one as all that you need to do is download the YT Studio app, and access a central location where all the comments for all the videos can be viewed. The process is given below:

**Step 1: Obtain a Mobile App**

Go to **App Store** or **Google Play Store**, and search and download the **YT Studio** app on your iPhone or Android smartphone (iPhone X is used here for illustration).

**Step 2: View/Access All the Comments**

Launch the **YT Studio** app, and sign in to your YouTube account. Tap the **Menu** icon from the top-left corner of the interface, and tap **Comments** from the menu to view all the published comments for all the videos that you have received on your YouTube channel.

**Step 3: Hide Users and View Held Comments**

Tap the **More** button from the right of an inappropriate comment, and tap **Hide user from channel** from the menu that comes up. In addition, you can tap the **More** button next to **Published** from the top, and tap **Held for review** from the box that pops up to view the comments that are waiting for your approval.

**Note:** Unfortunately, you cannot hold the comments for approval using the YT Studio app. As a workaround, you can follow the procedure given earlier to access the desktop version of YouTube on your smartphone, and then use the method explained in the previous section to get this done. However, it is recommended that you do all such sensitive tasks on a laptop or desktop computer to avoid any errors.

## Part 3: Find Someone’s YouTube Comments by User Name

If any of your YouTube videos has thousands of comments and you need to find a particular one from a specific user, checking each remark manually would be an extremely time-consuming and tedious task. Therefore, it is a good idea to let an efficient application do the job for you.

One program, a Google Chrome extension called YCS – YouTube Comment Search to be precise, can help you with this. All you are required to do is, install the extension, go to the video, and search the comment by the name of the user. The step-by-step instructions on how this can be done are given below:

**Step 1: Install YCS – YouTube Comment Search**

Launch Google Chrome on your desktop or laptop computer, search for **YCS – YouTube Comment Search**, click **Add to Chrome**, and click **Add extension** on the notification box that pops up to install the YCS – YouTube Comment Search extension on your instance of Google Chrome.

**Step 2: Load All Comments**

Go to your or any other’s YouTube video, and click **Load All** from the top-right corner of the YouTube Comment Search panel that is present under the description box to allow YCS to scan all the comments the video has received.

![Find  YouTube Comments mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/load-all-comments-with-youtube-comment-search-extension.jpg)

**Step 3: Search Comments from a Particular User**

Choose **Comments** from the search type drop-down list, enter the name of the user in question in the **Search** box, and click **Search** to fetch all their comments on the video.

## Part 4: How to Edit and Reply to YouTube Comments?

Editing an existing YouTube comment that you have posted earlier, or replying to the one published by someone else is simple. The process is given below:

**Step 1: Edit an Existing Comment**

Use any of the methods explained above to locate your YouTube comment that you want to edit. Next, click the **More** icon from the right of the comment, click **Edit** from the menu, make the required changes to the text, and click **SAVE**.

**Step 2: Reply to a Comment**

## Part 5: How to Moderate YouTube Comments?

If you publish videos on YouTube that may put some impact on people’s lifestyle, you are likely to face criticism quite often. Therefore, you might want to moderate all your comments before they become visible to the audience so as not to spread negativity among the mass. Fortunately, YouTube helps you get this done easily, and the instructions that teach you the process are given below:

**Step 1: Get to Your Channel’s Settings Box**

Sign in to your YouTube account, click the **Menu** icon from the top-left corner of the homepage, and click **Your videos** from the menu that appears.

From the bottom of the navigation bar on the left of the **YouTube Studio** page, click **Settings** to open the channel’s **Settings** box.

**Step 2: Moderate YouTube Comments**

Go to the **Community** category from the left pane, and go to the **Defaults** tab from the right. Next, choose **Hide all comments for review** from the **Comments on your new videos** drop-down list, and click **SAVE** from the bottom-right corner of the box to moderate all YouTube comments that your new videos receive from this point onward.

## Part 6: Tips for Writing Good YouTube Comments

While posting a comment on a YouTube video, it is imperative to keep a few things in mind. Some important tips that might come in handy in this regard are suggested below:

* Make your comment as relevant to the video as you possibly can
* Avoid using harsh language or slangs to maintain decency
* Be genuine while leaving feedback. However, make sure to choose polite words while typing a comment
* In case you want to add some suggestions, make sure to be humble
* Ignore the replies with inappropriate content

## FAQs About YouTube Comments

**Q1) Why can’t I see the comments I posted?**

**A:** If you cannot see your comments, this could be because the owner or moderator has configured the channel or the video to hold all the comments for review before they are visible on YouTube.

In such a case, you are advised to wait for the authorized person to approve your remark before it is published. Another possibility is that the moderator/owner has added you to the ‘hidden users’ list due to some reason. Even in this case, your comment won’t be visible until you are removed from that list.

**Q2) I have enabled** **‘Notify me’ about comments and other activity on my channel or videos, but can’t see the comments on my video. Why?**

**A:** You won’t be able to view the unpublished comments or those from the users you have added to the ‘hidden’ list. To fix this problem, you may want to disable moderation from your channel or the videos, and also unhide the users. The processes of both these configurations are explained in detail in the above sections.

## Earning Potential for Videos Amassing 1 Million Views

How much does YouTube pay for 1 million views? As a YouTuber, you become a business, and it helps to know the YouTube views to money earned.

If you are trying to earn a living on YouTube, one of the most excellent marks of a successful creator is often earning 1 million views on the platform ([click here for tips on how to do that](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/24-smart-ways-that-actually-work---how-to-grow-309.html)). It usually serves as a benchmark for a time at which a channel is relatively sustainable. However, rather than meaning a YouTuber has made it big financially, reaching 1 million views is more likely to say they can expect to _start_ making real money.

When you hit 1 million views on any video on YouTube, you'll have a nice paycheck. You'll likely have to hit 1 million views on at least a few other videos before you could consider quitting your full-time job and doing YouTube as your primary source of income. This article will explore what 1 million views mean for your YouTube channel. We will look more into how revenue is calculated on YouTube and what you can expect to earn-out of a video with 1 million views.

#### In this article

01 [$2000 for 1 million views](#part1)

02 [How is the revenue calculated?](#part2)

03 [CPMs and CPCs](#part3)

04 [How monetization is changing](#part4)

## $2000 for 1 Million Views

In [a case study performed by Standupbits](https://www.fastcompany.com/3018123/a-million-youtube-views-wont-pay-your-rent-but-tubestart-could) and Josef Holm, a YouTube channel is created with over 3500 comedy clips that a comedian and stand up actor had put together over the years. The YouTube clips took extensive time to upload, and the library was prevalent. The YouTube ad revenue only equated to around $2000.

Although StandUpBits had uploaded thousands of clips and received over 1 million views on their channel, their library was only able to earn around $2000 from the ad revenue sharing. It's estimated the group had spent approximately $25,000 to finish off the clips, edit them, and upload them, which means they invested far more in the channel than they earned.

If you are thinking about a career on YouTube, reaching 1 million views might seem like an excellent target for making a successful page, and it is, but reaching 1 million views doesn’t magically guarantee financial success.

## How Revenue is Calculated

In order to understand how revenue is calculated over the YouTube marketplace, a YouTube user needs to first understand what the partnership program entails. Basically, a YouTube partner has the ability to monetize their videos and serve ads on their content.

In order to join this program you need to be able to commit to uploading ad-friendly (nothing controversial) content that is completely original and high quality and which also adheres to all of the community guidelines and YouTube’s Terms of Service (YouTube actually just introduced a couple of stricter rules - click here for [YouTube Monetization 2018](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-monetization-2018---the-new-rules-everyone-hates-331.html)).

As of February 2018, to qualify for ad revenue, the YouTube channel must have:

1\. You will need to have 1,000 subscribers.

2\. You will need to have accumulated 4,000 hours of watch time over the last 12 months.

The AdSense revenue that you earn through YouTube will vary depending on a large number of factors related to the specific ads running and what type of content you produce.

## Understanding CPM and CPCs

### What is CPM?

CPM stands as the ‘cost per mille’ or ‘cost per thousand.’

Your CPM is the amount you earn for 1000 ad impressions (1000 viewers clicking on an ad or watching a skippable ad). Your CPM is usually related to the demographics of your users, the content you regularly post, the length of time on the videos that you post, and the gender of your viewers. YouTube CPMs can vary depending on the advertising bid the company has submitted with Google. The lowest bids can be around .33 cents per thousand views, and other advertisers can spend as much as $10 for 1000 views.

For example, gaming is the most prominent genre on YouTube, and there are many gaming-related ads to go around, but most of them are very low-paying (i.e., ads for free online games). Only YouTube gamers with extensive subscriber bases get higher-paying ads.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### What is CPC?

CPC means ‘cost per click.’ A CPC ad interprets an ‘ad impression’ as a click on an ad rather than a viewer merely seeing it. Most YouTube ads are CPC ads, but skippable video ads are CPV (cost per view), and impressions are based on viewers watching the ad instead of skipping it.

## Changes on YouTube and How You Can Earn More

Changes that have affected the way that revenue is calculated are the ability to skip ads and the lower click rates on advertising through YouTube. A huge portion of viewers uses ad blockers, which eliminates them as potential sources of revenue.

Ultimately earning ad revenue is a big game of reaching targeted demographics and [achieving ongoing viewership](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-convert-viewers-into-subscribers-%28the-easy-way%29-287.html) for your videos. It does matter where your viewers are going to be viewing from, and the audience that your viewers are in (viewers from areas with more disposable income to spend on the products advertised to them are worth more to advertisers, as are viewers who are interested in higher-cost items).

[Forming relationships with brands](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/tips-for-youtube-brand-deals-from-marketing-pro-amanda-haines-171.html) and doing product placements or sponsored videos can be a great way to earn more revenue than you will through AdSense. Just make sure the brands you build relationships with are relevant to your audience and that you incorporate the advertising in ways that don’t annoy your viewers.

Use the right keywords in your titles, descriptions, and tags. Without this keyword information, YouTube may pair your video with advertisers that aren’t right for your audience. First, using the wrong keywords won’t put your content in front of the viewers who want to see it, and, second, the ads that run won’t be a good fit and thus are less likely to be clicked on. It's also imperative that you focus on the metadata of every video. It can take some extra time to add in all of this information for each video, but it is well worth it if you are trying to get paid from YouTube.

In [a case study performed by Standupbits](https://www.fastcompany.com/3018123/a-million-youtube-views-wont-pay-your-rent-but-tubestart-could) and Josef Holm, a YouTube channel is created with over 3500 comedy clips that a comedian and stand up actor had put together over the years. The YouTube clips took extensive time to upload, and the library was prevalent. The YouTube ad revenue only equated to around $2000.

Although StandUpBits had uploaded thousands of clips and received over 1 million views on their channel, their library was only able to earn around $2000 from the ad revenue sharing. It's estimated the group had spent approximately $25,000 to finish off the clips, edit them, and upload them, which means they invested far more in the channel than they earned.

If you are thinking about a career on YouTube, reaching 1 million views might seem like an excellent target for making a successful page, and it is, but reaching 1 million views doesn’t magically guarantee financial success.

## How Revenue is Calculated

In order to understand how revenue is calculated over the YouTube marketplace, a YouTube user needs to first understand what the partnership program entails. Basically, a YouTube partner has the ability to monetize their videos and serve ads on their content.

In order to join this program you need to be able to commit to uploading ad-friendly (nothing controversial) content that is completely original and high quality and which also adheres to all of the community guidelines and YouTube’s Terms of Service (YouTube actually just introduced a couple of stricter rules - click here for [YouTube Monetization 2018](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-monetization-2018---the-new-rules-everyone-hates-331.html)).

As of February 2018, to qualify for ad revenue, the YouTube channel must have:

1\. You will need to have 1,000 subscribers.

2\. You will need to have accumulated 4,000 hours of watch time over the last 12 months.

The AdSense revenue that you earn through YouTube will vary depending on a large number of factors related to the specific ads running and what type of content you produce.

## Understanding CPM and CPCs

### What is CPM?

CPM stands as the ‘cost per mille’ or ‘cost per thousand.’

Your CPM is the amount you earn for 1000 ad impressions (1000 viewers clicking on an ad or watching a skippable ad). Your CPM is usually related to the demographics of your users, the content you regularly post, the length of time on the videos that you post, and the gender of your viewers. YouTube CPMs can vary depending on the advertising bid the company has submitted with Google. The lowest bids can be around .33 cents per thousand views, and other advertisers can spend as much as $10 for 1000 views.

For example, gaming is the most prominent genre on YouTube, and there are many gaming-related ads to go around, but most of them are very low-paying (i.e., ads for free online games). Only YouTube gamers with extensive subscriber bases get higher-paying ads.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### What is CPC?

CPC means ‘cost per click.’ A CPC ad interprets an ‘ad impression’ as a click on an ad rather than a viewer merely seeing it. Most YouTube ads are CPC ads, but skippable video ads are CPV (cost per view), and impressions are based on viewers watching the ad instead of skipping it.

## Changes on YouTube and How You Can Earn More

Changes that have affected the way that revenue is calculated are the ability to skip ads and the lower click rates on advertising through YouTube. A huge portion of viewers uses ad blockers, which eliminates them as potential sources of revenue.

Ultimately earning ad revenue is a big game of reaching targeted demographics and [achieving ongoing viewership](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-convert-viewers-into-subscribers-%28the-easy-way%29-287.html) for your videos. It does matter where your viewers are going to be viewing from, and the audience that your viewers are in (viewers from areas with more disposable income to spend on the products advertised to them are worth more to advertisers, as are viewers who are interested in higher-cost items).

[Forming relationships with brands](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/tips-for-youtube-brand-deals-from-marketing-pro-amanda-haines-171.html) and doing product placements or sponsored videos can be a great way to earn more revenue than you will through AdSense. Just make sure the brands you build relationships with are relevant to your audience and that you incorporate the advertising in ways that don’t annoy your viewers.

Use the right keywords in your titles, descriptions, and tags. Without this keyword information, YouTube may pair your video with advertisers that aren’t right for your audience. First, using the wrong keywords won’t put your content in front of the viewers who want to see it, and, second, the ads that run won’t be a good fit and thus are less likely to be clicked on. It's also imperative that you focus on the metadata of every video. It can take some extra time to add in all of this information for each video, but it is well worth it if you are trying to get paid from YouTube.
