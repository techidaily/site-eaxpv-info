MOV file format and iMovie editing software are both developed by Apple, and they theoretically should accept each other. However, sometimes iMovie will refuse you to import MOV files, or iMovie imports only audio or only video from MOV files.

**Why can’t import MOV to iMovie perfectly?**

Put succinctly, there are mainly three reasons, say wrong video or audio codec, large file size and corrupted MOV file.

Codec issue is the main reason causing over 90% MOV files not importing to iMovie problems. MOV is a container format that can contain different codecs including MPEG-4, H.264, HEVC, MPEG-2, WMV V8, AIC, MJPEG, ProRes, Sorenson 1/3, PNG, etc. However, only AIC or H.264 ,DV, MPEG-4, MPEG-2 is authorized to be accepted by iMovie on both Mac and Windows PC. That’s why sometimes you can’t import MOV files from iPhone, GoPro, Canon, DJI, etc. to iMovie. Besides, if your iMovie and computer operating system is too old to support newer MOV codec like HEVC and ProRes, you can’t import MOV to iMovie either.

In addition to that, MOV files are often large in size which will occupy much space in hard drive, leading to the rejection problem. BTW, if your MOV files are corrupted, you have to repair them first before importing.

Accordingly, over 90% problems about MOV not importing to iMovie are caused by incompatible codec, you are highly suggested to convert MOV to iMovie supported formats with a video converter like [MacX Video Converter Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).
