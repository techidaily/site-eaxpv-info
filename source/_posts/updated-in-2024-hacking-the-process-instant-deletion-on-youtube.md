YouTube is a video platform where people share informative and entertaining content. It works in the form of channels belonging to individuals or companies. People can subscribe to these channels to show support, and YouTubers create a strong sense of community with these subscribers.

But some people comment inappropriate comments that can cause the community harm and spread hatred. Many YouTubers may want to delete such remarks. There are also times when you accidentally comment on a channel’s comment section and may wish to delete it.

So how do you delete all YouTube comments? In this how-to blog, we will show you.

4. Once you reach the target comment, click on the three vertical dots at the bottom corner. There should be an option called Remove. Tap on it.
