The video starts in black and white, with the boy band donning silk suits. After about 36 seconds, the color of the video changes. The choreography in the video reflects the upbeat and flirtatious vibe of this song. The band tried to put loads of emotions into it. Essentially, signature moves include brushing their hair back, kissing their hands, and giving a mischievous look.

Additionally, the video featured a technicolor elevator sequence whereby each member freestyles their dance moves. At one point, the septet forms the word ARMY using their bodies as a homage to their fans.

#### 2) Dynamite by BTS

Dynamite was released in August 2020, and it's the first song this South Korean boy band has recorded in English. The music video earned 100 million YouTube views in 23 hours and 25 minutes. After 20 minutes of its release, Butter broke the record by garnering the fastest 10 million views on YouTube.

The upbeat disco-pop song has elements of bubblegum pop, soul, and funk, and it takes influence from the Seventies music. It features celebratory horns, echoing synths, and snapping handclaps. The song is about feeling joy and appreciation for the small things in life that make it valuable.

#### 3) How You Like That by Blackpink

Blackpink's How You Like That was recorded in two languages (Japanese and Korean. It was released through Interscope Records, YG Plus, and YG Entertainment. It's a club, trap, hip hop, EDM, and pop song. The music video took one day and eight hours to amass 100 million YouTube views, making it one of the fastest 100 million views on YouTube.

The video starts with Jisoo, Lisa, Jennie, and Rosé sitting like monarchs on steps. The colorful music video shows the quartet delivering a strong kiss-off to an unseen enemy and a message of resilience. They also dance in different places in the video, displaying a range of dance moves.

#### 4) Boy With Love by BTS and Halsey

Boy with Luv is the lead single for BTS' 6th extended play called Map of the Soul: Persona. Its release date is April 12, 2019, under Big Hit Entertainment. The video garnered 100 million views in one day and 13 hours.

The music video has vibrant visuals, and it starts with the American singer and songwriter Halsey sitting bored behind a booth that sells tickets. The scene then flashes to BTS, clad in different shades of hot pink and delivering their dynamic choreography in front of Persona, a retro movie theater. The cinematic visual then unfolds, setting the septet against kaleidoscopic backdrops, as they dance, rap, and sing.

#### 5) Ice Cream by Blackpink Featuring Selena Gomez

Released on August 28, 2020, Ice Cream is the second single from The Album, Blackpink's first Korean-language studio album. Ice Cream took one day and 16 hours to get 100 million views on YouTube, making it one of the fastest 100 million views on this video-sharing platform.

In the music video, Selena, Lisa, Rosé Jisoo, and Jennie are wearing different clothes and sets. Selena is seen in a high-waisted, red-and-white-striped Shoshanna bikini; her next look includes an Eighties-inspired Puma bodysuit. The five girls portray several versions of today's woman image who know what they are worth and what they want.

#### 6) Lalisa by Lisa

Lalisa is the debut single by Lisa of Blackpink; it's the lead single from the musician's debut album of the same name. The song is a dynamic hip-hop track with influence from Thai culture. The music video garnered 100 million YouTube views in two days and one hour.

The video is visually-packed with ten set-ups and 13 outfit changes, making it exciting to watch. In the video, the artist appears sitting perched on an ornate throne, and she is adorned in gold jewelry with matching nails. The best part of her outfit is the traditional Thai headdress, which is tiered and anointed with flowers. Lisa ascends to the throne while she's alternately executing excellent, intricate choreography.

#### 7) Permission to Dance by BTS

Permission to Dance was released July 9, 2021, through Sony Music and Big Hit Music as a stand-alone single. It's the group's third English-language single. Mac, Andrews, and Stephen Kirk were in charge of the production.

The music video hit 100 million views in two days and two hours. In the video, the boy band wears cowboy outfits and breaks their dance moves in the Western background. The theme of Permission to Dance looks like the end of the coronavirus pandemic as nations resume their normal activities and declare the worst of this disease seems to be behind them.

#### 8) Life Goes on by BTS

Released through Columbia Records and Big Hit Entertainment on November 20, 2020, Life Goes On is the lead single from BTS' 5th Korean-language studio album Be. It was produced by j-hope, SUGA, Antonia Armato, Chris James, Ruuth, RM, and Pdogg.

The video reached 100 million views on YouTube in 2 days and 3 hours. And this makes it among the fastest 100 million views on YouTube. The band appears to be lounging lazily, playing a video game. One of the members comes, V, with pizza, and they enjoy it together. V then takes the other members for a drive. When they came back, they watched some movies. They later went to a stadium and performed this song without the audience.

#### 9) Kill This Love by Blackpink

Kill This Love was released by YG Entertainment on April 5, 2019, and it was distributed through Interscope Records and YG Plus. It's the group's first Korean material since June 2018, when they released Square Up. The song is the lead single and Blackpink's debut release with Interscope Records. Its official music video amassed 100 million views in 2 days and 14 hours.

The music video begins with introduction shots of each member of Blackpink; they are in a room surrounded by trumpets. Jennie performs with 2 massive swan set pieces with the sunset behind her. Lisa then struts around a candy shop as she knocks things off shelves and kicks displays. The scene with Jisoo is a stark contrast, as we see the sun against a black setting with her head being above a pool of water. Next, viewers will see a distraught Rosé, as she's driving a sports car fast chasing down her doppelganger.

#### 10) Psy Gentleman

Gentleman, a K-pop song, was released on April 12, 2013\. It serves as the follow-up to Psy's hit single Gangnam Style. Gentleman's music video took 2 days and 19 hours to get 100 million views on YouTube. Also, it held the record as the fastest YouTube video to 100 million views for more than six years.

The video features the artist performing different pranks on people; Psy later meets a lady who pulls pranks on him. Psy is wearing a tuxedo and sunglasses as he walks a paved street hill together with a company of relatively older men. He then stops and kicks a traffic cone.

# How to Buy YouTube Views - Everything You Need To Know

This article has everything you need to know before you buy YouTube views, including:

1. [Where to Buy Views](#where)
2. [How Does it Work?](#how)
3. [What to Look for in a Service](#what)
4. [Is Buying Views Illegal?](#illegal)
5. [Will Buying Views Get Me Banned From YouTube?](#banned)

**Disclaimer: We in no way endorse the practice of buying views. It could be dangerous for your channel and will damage your credibility with your real viewers if they find out.**

YouTube is one of the fastest-growing social media platforms today. The amount of time we spend watching YouTube videos daily is simply mindboggling. The amazing thing about YouTube is how easy it is to share content and, in the process, build your audience. Many people have launched careers on the success of their videos and the popularity of their channels. It doesn’t matter if you are an expert, a hobbyist, an aspiring musician, a citizen journalist, a DIY maven, a cook, or a makeup fiend – YouTube can help you reach more people, develop your brand and launch your new career. All you have to do is create your channel, upload good videos, promote your content, and watch the magic happen. Well, if only it were that simple…

In reality, getting people to watch your content can be difficult. Even for people who have large personal networks, hitting 5000 or 10000 views can be tough. The reason is simply that YouTube videos, like other web content, thrive on Social Proof, and Social Proof equals credibility. The more views a video has, the more people are willing to watch it, and the better its chances of featuring as recommended content. It’s a vicious cycle. Time and time again, we see that given the choice, people would rather watch a video with 2000 views instead of a video with 200 views.

This is why [buying YouTube views can be a great way](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to jumpstart the organic views of your content. It’s no silver bullet of course, but it can get you off to a good start. Buying YouTube views can help your video gain traction and get recommended. The trick is to buy from sources that provide real US and UK views in ways that do not violate YouTube’s Terms of Service (TOS). There are many scam services out there that can get your video the wrong kind of attention. Be sure to do your research before you buy, and understand that this is a tactic which promises short-term results. Buying YouTube views can be useful. However, it is no guarantee of long-term success. You still need to put hard work into your content for it to work.

## WHERE TO BUY VIEWS

These top 5 sites for buying YouTube views are ranked according to the quality of the targeted views they deliver, viewer engagement, responsiveness, turnaround time, and their moneyback guarantee (if they have one). The site which tested these services is called [**BuyViewsReview**](http://buyviewsreview.com/). To learn more about the top providers of YouTube views, and how you can avoid scams, [click here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

**Tip:** you want ‘high retention views’ – views where your video has been watched for a significant period, not just clicked on. These will help your search engine rankings.

### 1\. DEVUMI

_[Devumi](https://devumi.com/)_ is our #1 pick for buying YouTube views because it provides the best value for money. To start with, all Devumi’s packages come with likes included so there’s no need to shop around for engagement and retention after buying views from Devumi. They have a 100% money-back guarantee and some of the fastest turnaround time available on the market (for genuine high-retention views. Some bot services are faster, but it’s against YouTube’s TOS to use bots).

### 2\. BuyViews

_[BuyViews](https://buyviews.co/)_ come in at a close second to Devumi. They offer various social promotion options along with their packages. They also have an impressive 60% – 90% retention rate as well as a 100% moneyback guarantee. However, their turnaround time isn’t as good as Devumi’s. Also, they provide no time guarantee on their retention rate.

### 3\. MarketingHeaven

_[MarketingHeaven](https://themarketingheaven.com/)_ makes buying YouTube views very easy. On their homepage, you can add the link to the video you’d like to promote, select the number of views you want from a dropdown list and top it off with an optional selection of likes. While this ease of use is a plus, MarketingHeaven is a bit more expensive than the top 2 sites on this list, and it provides no retention guarantee. Also, it takes longer to see results and it provides no options for social promotion.

### 4\. 500VIEWS

On _[500VIEWS](http://500views.com/)_ you can buy everything, including YouTube views, likes, comments, and subscribers. They have an add-ons system that’s very easy to use. However, they don’t deliver on quality, retention, engagement, and customer support like the top 3 sites. It can also take up to 1 week to get results from 500VIEWS.

### 5\. Social Shop

_Social Shop_ has a very nice mix of packages. At the lowest end, they have the micro package which gets you 1000 views for $2, and at the high end, they have the Pro package which gets you 1,000,000 views for $999\. Considering this range of options, their turnaround time of 2 days isn’t bad at all. However, Social Shop has limited engagement options. Unlike other sites on this list, they do not provide likes, comments, or subscribers. Their customer support also doesn’t compare too well against others on this list.

## HOW DOES IT WORK?

Buying YouTube views is easy and safe if you buy from reliable sources like the sites at the top of the list above. It also helps to know how YouTube judges view to understand why it’s important to choose the right source.

YouTube ranks views based on the location of the viewers and the quality of viewer engagement. When a user who is based in the US or UK uploads a video and it gets most of its views from Russia or Asia, that raises a red flag. YouTube checks to see that a good number of video viewers are part of the user’s target demographic, and that makes sense. You want targeted YouTube views because that can boost organic retention rates significantly. Untargeted views can lead to a high bounce rate which can lead YouTube to conclude that your video has been mistitled, among other things.

The best sellers of YouTube views go the extra mile to provide a mixed demographic of views with targeted hits from the US and UK to avoid the wrong kind of attention.

Some sellers simply rent IPs from different places and send them to the video link. While this method might not be detected by YouTube, it offers very low retention because there are no real people behind those IP addresses. It is always best to buy from sellers who can send real people to watch, like, and comment on your videos. Anything else is risky and can bring your content under increased scrutiny from YouTube.

## WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE

The most important thing to look for in a good view buying website is a guarantee that you’ll be getting real humans, not bots, to watch your video. This is the only way to get organic retention and engagement from your purchase. While robots will inflate your views, there’ll be little else to show for those high numbers. Bot views won’t help you rank in search results, and they may hurt your chances of ranking (they also violate YouTube’s TOS and can get your videos taken down). With human views, things can be different.

Bear in mind that buying views will not guarantee long-term success or impactful engagement. This is why buying YouTube views is seen as a short-term tactic for jumpstarting organic growth and not something to keep on doing forever. Content creators still have to promote their content and build real relationships with their viewers to see meaningful results in the long term.

Next, you want to be sure that your view buying website can deliver targeted views. If you’re based in the UK, you want views from the UK, US, Australia, and Canada. Views originating predominantly from Russia or certain parts of Eastern Europe and Asia could give you away, and you’d run the risk of disciplinary action from YouTube. Buying views isn’t technically against the rules, as long as they are human views, but if YouTube suspects there is a bot at work then they won’t be interested in any appeals about how ‘the service said they didn’t use bots’.

It’s also important to buy from providers whose viewers are active on YouTube. Their history of activity on YouTube will only boost the credibility of their views and by extension, the credibility of your video and its growing popularity.

Finally, you want to avoid sellers who provide views in a way that can put you at risk. Sites that provide views from similar IPs and same browsers with the same or similar cookies are just too obvious. YouTube can pick-up on that kind of activity and you could potentially have a problem on your hands.

## IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?

No. This goes double for users who are not monetizing their content. Videos that promote violence and copyright violations are illegal. Buying views is not against the law, or even YouTube's Terms of Service depending on where your views come from.

YouTube’s TOS does state clearly that partners are not to engage third parties to “… generate artificial subscribers or views.” Partners are generally understood to be users who are monetizing their channels through affiliate programs or AdSense, and ‘artificial’ means the views need to come from a bot to be against the rules. However, some interpret this to mean that buying YouTube views is against the TOS for all users. It seems like YouTube would rather you not buy views at all since the language is ambiguous, but since there’s a way in which buying ads through Google for your channel could be seen as buying views they haven’t formally outlawed it. Whatever your perspective, there’s no denying that buying views is a risky business. This is all the more reason you should choose the sites you buy from carefully.

Also, keep in mind that tech companies like Google constantly review their policies. Bloggers have had to change tactics with changes to Google’s search engine algorithm. There’s no telling how things may change or evolve with YouTube in the future. That is why we strongly recommend that you buy views from websites that can deliver real human views with strong guarantees of service delivery and reliable turnaround times. Anything short of this could expose you and your content to the kind of attention you certainly don’t want.

## WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?

As mentioned above, buying views alone is unlikely to get you banned from YouTube. The worst-case scenario is that your video may be taken down for ‘view count gaming’ and even then, there’s an appeals process. The important thing is to understand Google and YouTube’s Terms of Service (TOS). Only explicit and egregious violations of their TOS could get your banned. You should also be mindful that community policing is a big part of how YouTube discovers users who may violate their TOS. If many viewers flag your video for takedown due to copyright violation or abusive content, that can lead to serious disciplinary action from YouTube and in some cases, you may be banned for life.

That’s why it’s important to buy likes and comments as well if you’re going to buy a large number of views – lots of views and no engagement will make organic viewers think you used a bot and they may report you.

Buying YouTube views is not illegal and certainly will not incur the same kind of disciplinary action as clear violations of YouTube’s TOS. What matters is that you buy your views in a way that won’t attract the wrong kind of attention. YouTube will sometimes flag videos for view auditing. If views are found to be fake, the view count is dropped to exclude fake views. If this has happened to you after you bought YouTube views, be wary of buying from the same source again. If your video is repeatedly found to be attracting purchased fake views, it may be taken down.

## Conclusion

We see videos with thousands and millions of views so often that it’s easy to forget just how difficult it can be to get people to watch your videos. YouTube is very competitive, and it takes time to build a reputation, and the following needed to become a YouTube star.

To compete for viewer attention and engagement, it helps to have good numbers. Buying views can give you an edge by telling people that your content is worth their time. Just be sure to buy your views from the right sources. And after you’ve bought your views, do your part to [promote your video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on YouTube and other social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Also, engage with your audience and create content consistently. With all these in place, your audience will grow organically, and eventually, you may get your moment in the spotlight.

 What do you think? Would you buy YouTube views, or can you get by growing your channel organically?
