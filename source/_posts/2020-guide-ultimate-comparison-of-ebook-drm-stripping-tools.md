Learning something about the eBook DRM removal will benefit you a lot. As the fact that many of the eBooks we purchase and download from the mainstream eBook stores like Amazon, Kobo, Nook, Google Play are protected with DRM, we are always limited by eBook DRM. We cannot read those ebooks freely on any software or device we like, cannot choose the format we like or the format to read, and cannot share good ebooks with our families and friends. It's a great pain if the eBook is DRMed, isn't it? So follow me to know several DRM removal tools and get your locked books free.

Now restart Calibre and add your DRMed books to it. Usually it will remove the books' DRM automatically. If your DRMed books are already in your Calibre library, you should remove them from Calibre first and then re-add them to Calibre, or their DRM will not be removed.

### Conclusion

If you are really accustomed to using Calibre all the time, you can consider to add the DRM Removal plugins to Calibre and remove eBook DRM. When I was trying this way to remove DRM, I failed to remove the DRM sometimes. So I personally don't like DeDRM plugins much. Besides, the whole process is a little bit difficult for most of us. It's better to choose Epubor Ultimate to remove eBook DRM. It's born to be a DRM removal tool for eBooks, isn't it?

Unfortunately, the iBooks DRM removal tool Requiem v4.1 no longer works in Mac Mojave - which, to be fair, isn't listed on their webpage as a supported version of MacOS. Your article is from 2017.

 Is there an equivalent that still works on 2020 that you know of?

I'm so sorry if this is a dumb question but I've read so many articles and some say you can and some say you can't....I have an iPad mini from several years ago with tons of iBooks. I've downloaded them all to my PC with the purpose of removing the DRM so I can read them through the kindle app on my Samsung tablet. Is there ANY program that will allow me to do this so I can read my books purchased through the iTunes store years ago on something other than my iPad? At this point even having an app that will read them on the Samsung tablet without removing the DRM. I'd like them all in the kindle app for convenience but I'll take anything right now.
