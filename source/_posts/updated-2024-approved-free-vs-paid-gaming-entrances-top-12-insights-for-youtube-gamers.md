So, in the first part, I’ll show you some of the **best gaming intro makers for YouTube video**, some of them are free to use, others may need to subscribe.

#### 4\. Cinema 4D: $3510.5

This is a complete and complex software for 3D video animation, it's developed by MAXON Computer GmbH in Germany, and it gives you almost all the power and control over 3D design and creation.
