## Part 2: How to Choose the Right Yoga Channel for Yourself?

Based on your level of yoga practice and needs, the channel will vary. But it is better to divide yoga practitioners in two basic ways. One is the beginner-level practitioners, and the other is the advanced-level practitioners.

If you are a beginner-level yoga practitioner, you can try to pick one pose at a time and explore it as deep as possible with time. In this article, you will find the first six best yoga YouTube channels suitable for beginner-level yoga practitioners.

## Part 3: How to Start Your Own Yoga Channel on YouTube?

Most practitioners now practice yoga from home and so do the instructors. Here are a few tips on how to start your own yoga channel on YouTube.

### Tip 1\. Set your target audience

There are different levels of yoga practitioners as well as their lifestyle. A working mom may give you 10 minutes from her morning routine while a college-going student can give you 10 minutes in the afternoon. Hence, first you need to set your target audience and create your content based on that.

### Tip 2\. Upload videos as scheduled

As you are instructing yoga through your YouTube channel, you need to keep your audience updated. A good way to keep them updated is creating a schedule to upload videos on a regular basis. You can also post the schedule on the description of your channel so that your audience waits for the next.

Creating a brand out of yoga practicing is the next thing you can do. When people hear the name of your YouTube channel, they value it for its brand. Make it just like this. It can be under your name or your studio’s name. Nevertheless, it should propose a brand value.

### Tip 4\. Rank on SEO

The present era is full of competition. If you cannot rank among the top ones, you cannot actually get to the audience and make a business out of it. Hence, you should learn to rank on search engine optimization so that people interested in yoga get to your first.

### Tip 5\. Proper video editing
