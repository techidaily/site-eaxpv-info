##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

To grow a Youtube channel, you need to focus on several different factors and elements. Having an attractive and eye-catching thumbnail is one of those top factors that contribute to the growth of your channel. No matter how good your content is, if you cannot attract users to click on your videos, it will not benefit your channel. In this article, we are going to show you how you can make a Fortnite thumbnail in few simple steps using Filmora X. If you are a content creator and love to make Fortnite videos, then this article will be very helpful for you.

Filmora has recently introduced a new feature named AI Portrait that uses Artificial Intelligence to remove the background from a portrait or image. This feature doesn't require any green screen to do that. Filmora also contains a wide range of elements and titles that help you enhance the Thumbnail and make look stunning and eye-catching.

---

**Step 01:** To start making a Fortnite thumbnail, it is important to have a screenshot of your gameplay. We can make a perfect screenshot using Fortnite Replay Mode. If you have recently played a Fortnite match, you can access its replay under the Career tab. Under the Career tab select Replays.

![make-fortnite-thumbnail-step1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step1.jpg)

**Step 02:** If you are using a console, the game will only store 10 recent gameplays, but if you are using a PC, it will store 100 recent gameplays in this section. From all these gameplays, select the one that you want to use for the Thumbnail. Once you choose gameplay, you can control everything in it. The angle, speed, and camera mode.
