Find the popular topic, like the cranial nerve exam, hair-salon, policeman catching thieves, and doctor role-play. Gain experience from such unique ideas and give it a try before experimenting with your original content to attract a small audience.

#### 2\. Be natural

If it is your first ASMR video, and you are not sure how to proceed, you can get assistance from your friend who has prior experience in it. You can also incorporate them while making a video. Doing so will reduce your insecurity in-camera exposure.

#### 5\. Film videos at night

This option might sound crazy, but it’s true as you will not have a distraction like traffic, cars, dogs, people conversations, and loud noise that might affect the video quality.

#### 6\. Be proud

ASMR is becoming a growing trend, as said before, and it is a sensational topic. If you have decided to travel in that path, it is fair but think twice before you step into it.
