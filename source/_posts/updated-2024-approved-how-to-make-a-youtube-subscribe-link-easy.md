If you want to increase the total number of subscribers that you have on your YouTube page it is important that your page is easy to subscribe to.

A subscribe link is a link to your channel page which takes the person who clicks it to the same view of the page they would have if they had already clicked to subscribe. It triggers a pop-up asking them to confirm their subscription. If they were already interested enough to click the link and check out your channel they may confirm the subscription in the window, whereas they may forget to subscribe if they aren’t prompted.

A YouTube subscribe link is one of the best ways to share a link on your website, in social media posts, or anywhere you mention your channel.

## How to Get a YouTube Subscribe Link

YouTube subscribe links aren’t some kind of exclusive perk – anyone can have one!

**Step 1:** Go to your YouTube channel page and click into the address bar so you can edit the URL.

**Step 2:** Add the following to the end of your channel URL:

?sub\_confirmation=1

**Step 3:** Copy the entire URL including the part you added and paste it into a word document to save. Any time you share a link to your channel, make sure it is this link.

This will work both with channels that have custom URLs and channels which do not. Here’s an example:

_<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY\_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w>_

That's a link for Wondershare Filmora Video Editor's YouTube channel. With the modifier it looks like this:

_<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY\_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w?sub\_confirmation=1>_

Getting subscribers is tough, but you’ll get more if you ask and this is just another way of asking. The process for creating a YouTube subscribe link is easy and accessible to everyone.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Rearranging YouTube Playlists

We often create playlists on YouTube for different moods, genres, and occasions, but you may want to change the order of the videos or songs in your list. This is where the shuffling feature can help you.

Shuffling your YouTube playlist is an excellent way to mix things up and play various videos or songs from different channels without manually selecting each one.

But if you don't know how to use the "Shuffle" feature, we'll show you **how to shuffle YouTube playlists** on PCs, phones, and TVs. So, keep reading to start randomizing your YouTube playlist to mix up your music or video collection!

## How To Shuffle YouTube Playlist On PCs/Phones/TVs?

Whether it's a mix of our favorite songs, a set of dance videos to help get us through our workout, or a compilation of cat videos that never fail to make us smile, we all have that one go-to playlist we want to listen to over and over again.

But sometimes, even our favorite playlist can feel a little stale. That's when it's time to shuffle things up and give the playlist a fresh new feel.

To help you with this, we've provided step-by-step tutorials to help you shuffle Youtube playlists on your computer, phone, or Smart TV without having much trouble.

### Part 1\. How to Shuffle YouTube Playlist on PC?

**Step 1**: First, open a browser on your PC to visit the [**YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/) website and log in to your account using your credentials.

**Step 2**: Now, click the **"Menu"** (hamburger) icon on the top left of the **YouTube home page** and select your playlist from the menu.

**Step 1**: If the YouTube app is not installed on your phone, head to the "[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/youtube-watch-listen-stream/id544007664)" or "Google [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.youtube&hl=en&gl=US)" and install the app.

**Step 2:** Now, launch the YouTube app on your handy and tap the **"Library"** option at the bottom right corner of the app's home screen.

That's all to it! Now you can enjoy your YouTube playlist in totally random order.

### Part 3\. How To Shuffle YouTube Playlist on TV?

The YouTube app is also available on smart TVs, which many people find to be a more enjoyable experience than watching YouTube videos on a small screen.

However, unfortunately, there is no way to shuffle a YouTube playlist on a Smart TV. This is a feature that is currently only available on the YouTube website and apps.

But if your Smart TV comes with a built-in Chromecast option, you can screen mirror the YouTube app on your TV and shuffle the playlist to your liking in the following way:

**Step 1**: In the first step, make sure your Smart TV and mobile device are connected to the same internet connection.

**Step 2:** In the next step, launch the YouTube app on your device, and access your playlist under the **"Library"** tab. Tap the **"Shuffle"** icon in the playlist details section and play your playlist

**Step 3**: In the final step, tap the **"Cast"** icon at the top-right of the screen and select your TV from the list to cast to.

![shuffling youtube playlist smart tv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shuffling-youtube-playlist-on-smart-tv.png)

Now you can enjoy randomly listen to your favorite songs on a more prominent display without getting bored.

**Note:**

_You can also use other streaming devices like Firestick or Apple Airplay to cast YouTube on your Smart TV._
