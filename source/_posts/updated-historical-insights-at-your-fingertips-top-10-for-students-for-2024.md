This camera is equipped with a micro four-thirds sensor and can shoot UHD 4K and DCI videos at 60 fps, up to 150 Mbps. If you want to capture slow-motion footage, you can shoot full HD 1080p videos at 240 fps as well. With its 10.28MP multi-aspect ratio MOS sensor, you'll be able to produce high-quality videos even under very challenging lighting conditions. In a fraction of a second, this camera can also automatically grab focus during your video with its advanced depth-from-focus technology. It is also equipped with a microphone jack so that you can record better audio while shooting with this camera. The GH5S has a fully articulated touchscreen so that you can compose your shot from any angle.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 204800_ _\- High video bit rates_   **CONS** _\- Expensive_ _\- The camera body weighs about 1.5 lbs_ |
