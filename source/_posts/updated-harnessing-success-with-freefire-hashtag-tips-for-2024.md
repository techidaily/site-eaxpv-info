Originally, Smosh was a channel run by sketch comedy duo Ian Andrew Hecox and Anthony Padilla.

Most channels that have one viral video do not go on to have sustained success on YouTube, but Smosh is an exception to this rule. Their ‘Pokemon Theme Music Video’, released in 2005, became the most viewed video of all time (as of that year). This video kick-started the growth of their channel.
