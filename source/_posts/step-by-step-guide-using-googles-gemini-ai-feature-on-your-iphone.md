 Gemini is Google's latest and greatest AI tool. A combination of Google Bard and Duet AI, it's set to rival ChatGPT and DALL-E 3\. You don't need an Android phone or a desktop browser to try it out. We'll show you how to use Gemini AI on your iPhone or iPad.

 As of the time of writing, there is not a dedicated Gemini app for iPhone and iPad. Instead, it's available in the official Google app. [Gemini is free to use](https://location-social.techidaily.com/does-find-my-friends-work-on-vivo-x90s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), but you can upgrade to [Gemini Advanced](https://gemini.google.com/advanced?utm%5Fsource=gemini&utm%5Fmedium=web&utm%5Fcampaign=gemini%5Fadvanced%5Fannounce%5Fsh) for $20 per month for more, well, _advanced_ features.

##  How to Use Google Gemini AI on iPhone

 Gemini began rolling out to the [Google app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google/id284815942) for iPhone and iPad in early February 2024\. If you don't see what's shown in the screenshots below, you may need to wait a bit longer.

 ...and that's it! Unlike Android, there's not much more you can do. Gemini is simply available as an alternative to Google Search.

 Google's AI venture had a rocky start with Bard, but it has slowly become a legitimate competitor to ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot. Gemini can do [image generation](https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-from-novice-to-expert-your-path-in-google-photos/), [use extensions](https://fox-links.techidaily.com/in-2024-essential-compilation-top-8-4k-ultra-hd-players/), and more, though, like every AI product, [it's far from perfect](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-starting-point-connecting-seamlessly-via-instagram/).
