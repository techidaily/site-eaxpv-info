## What to look for game screen recorder

There are many people who do not have any knowledge regarding game capture software. You must look for the following things before choosing a game screen recorder.

* The option of personalizing the hotkeys
* Number of built-in tools
* How to begin and pause recording
* Number of codes offered by it
* Recording time
* Editing features like cut and paste
* Custom-made Recording Resolution
* Adjustable video frames

In addition to this, some game recorders also affect your in-game fps (Frame per second). You should also check whether it is compatible with large-sized files or not. The quality of the video also depends upon the file size. The larger is file size, the higher is video quality. However, you can face problems while uploading huge-sized videos as online content distributors hardly support such files. So you must compress your video before sharing anywhere. There are also some recorders that provide a direct link to social networking sites. Thus you should consider these factors also before purchasing the game recording software.

You can easily run this recorder on your computer if it is updated and has 8GB of RAM. PC should also have two storage drives so as to install gaming software on one drive and record videos on another drive. It is also advisable to use computers than laptops for recording screen activities because laptops rarely have two storage drives.

### Q2\. How do I record my screen smoothly?

You should do a couple of things to avoid lagging while screen recording your gameplay. For example, do not use your built-in microphone to record your voice during screen recording. Instead, use an external microphone.

Only record what is important. Use high RAM and have a good graphics card. And most importantly, get screen recorders with at least 60fps.

### Q3\. Does screen recording decrease FPS?

Yes, it does affect your overall gaming performance. However, it depends on several factors. For instance, the fps won't be affected much if you’re playing a less CPU-intensive game. The only way to sustain FPS is to have a high-quality screen recorder, such as OBS, Filmora, Bandicam, and Fraps.

### Method 1: Three dots option

One of the primary things you can do with any short videos is to click on the three dots next to each of such videos if you are not particularly willing to see something. Doing so will open the pop-up window, which will give you the option of “Not interested”. Click on this option. That’s it. Next time, such a video will not appear to you while surfing videos on YouTube.

![not intereted to ban youtube shorts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/disable-youtube-shorts-1.jpg)

Here, no doubt the method is simple, but this method needs repetitiveness. As, whenever you see Shorts videos, you need to click on three dots to remove that.

### Method 2: Settings menu of YouTube

At your YouTube homepage at the top end, you will see the profile icon. If you click on it, that will lead you towards the **Settings** menu of YouTube.

From there, you need to select “General”, which will show up some options. Here, click on the Shorts option to turn it off.

![turn of youtube shorts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/turn-off-youtube-shorts.jpg)

This way, by simply following and managing settings, you can easily disable YouTube shorts from the platform.

Now, restart your device to apply the removal process of YouTube shorts from there entirely. Thus, the next time you open the application, you will find that there exists no such YouTube shorts video as this option will disable YouTube Shorts.

### Method 3: Can go with YouTube browser

Hey guys, there is one more trick. Whenever you want to access YouTube, instead of going through the application, try to open YouTube website either from your mobile or PC browser window. You would wonder why so and what difference it will make. The fact is that the Shorts tab has not yet been incorporated under the browser version of YouTube.

So friends, try this to avoid seeing YouTube Shorts videos either from phone or desktop. This is not only simple but also device-free. And even if you do not have a YouTube application, you can use this trick to solve your concern.

### Method 4: Factory reset

If you disagree with the shorts video and want to get off of it entirely. This trick might help you. For this, visit the YouTube app on your mobile and press on it for some time. Doing so will lead you to the info section under the settings.

When you click on the **Uninstall** option, the YouTube version will get downgraded to the factory version. This is the version that is a pre-installed version of YouTube that comes with the device.

Also, if you have not updated your YouTube app, then don’t go with that. However, you will receive notifications many times that you should update your application. Just ignore it, especially if you are not willing to add the Shorts video option on your YouTube application.

### Method 5: Link to downgrade the YouTube

Friends, for every problem, there exists some solution. And, if you are finding it difficult to factory reset the YouTube, you can download the downgraded version of YouTube. This is the version that does not contain the YouTube Shorts feature. Do like this:

1. Visit the [Link](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/youtube/youtube-14-12-56-release/youtube-14-12-56-16-android-apk-download/) and download the downgraded version.
2. Install by allowing unknown resources also.

**Step 3: Open application and visit settings**

Once you have launched the application, under the settings, you need to go for the **Vanced settings** option> there opt for "Ad settings" > at the end of the page, switch on the **Shorts shelf**.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/disable-youtube-shorts-5.jpg)

Alternatively, remove the **YouTube Shorts** button also from the screen. Under the “Vanced settings” > Visit **Layout settings** \> Switch on the **Comments location** option. That will further remove the Shorts button from the bottom end of the Home screen of the YouTube page.
