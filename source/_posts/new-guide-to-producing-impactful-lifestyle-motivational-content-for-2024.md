Whether you are a lifestyle brand or not, you need to offer content that educates and informs your audience and stands out amongst the best in the industry. Videos are an excellent way to connect with the audience, especially for brands that wish to engage their customers with meaningful content.

Today, businesses of every size tend to favor lifestyle videos that better appeal to the audience and communicate the brand’s values. Creating an attractive lifestyle video can thus be the ticket to reach a wider audience and upgrade the digital presence of every business.

## What is Lifestyle Video?

Lifestyle content exemplifies the ‘lifestyle’ behind a product or service and appeals to the demographic that you are trying to reach. It is a form of video marketing that pushes products and services to customers by showing the quality of life associated with a particular brand.

The principal objective of lifestyle content is appealing to a specific demographic, culture, or subculture. With these videos, you can focus on your products and services, using stunning visuals and action shots to portray a beautiful picture of what your brand’s potential customers’ lives will be like if they become the consumer of your product and services.

## 6 Key Benefits of Creating a Lifestyle Video

#### 1\. Informing & Educating

One of the most significant benefits of lifestyle content is that it helps customers understand products. With a plethora of choices out there, marketers today are no longer taking the pitching kind of approach. They want to approach their audience with a value-based offer instead of sales. And with lifestyle videos, you can excel at giving customers a close-up look at your products and services.

#### 2\. Caters to Your Audience’s Interests

Lifestyle content caters to the target audience. Since these videos define your market and your brand, it carries a specific style that’s based on your aesthetics or looks. What makes video marketing so effective is that they can introduce your story and brand in an interesting way to potential customers.

#### 3\. Search Engine Optimization

Search engines love high-quality content like videos. Using lifestyle videos in your web pages and other types of content can thus work wonders for search engine optimization. As long as your lifestyle video is well-optimized with the right keywords, a solid title, and a good meta description, your video content can increase your web traffic.

#### 4\. Great Promotional Tool

Brands can distribute lifestyle content on different channels for reaching your target audience right away. Once you post the video on your website, you can share it on your social networking platforms or promote it with paid ads. This way, you can get customers excited about what you are offering them.

#### 5\. Taps into Emotions

Emotions are a significant component of the purchasing decision of consumers. Studies have found that ad campaigns with only emotional content perform about twice as well compared to those with only rational content. So, creating lifestyle video content that makes your audience feel good can put your business in a positive light.

#### 6\. Boosts Conversions

Lifestyle videos are excellent for conversions on websites as they influence visitors by promoting the lifestyle a customer can achieve if they patronize the product or service. What makes such content more compelling is that they excite customers about what you offer them.

## How to Create a Lifestyle Video?

The most stunning lifestyle videos are polished, sleek, and visually appealing. Developing a lifestyle video content that exceeds your target audience's expectations is vital to appeal to your customer’s perfect lifestyle. Creating these videos is easy if you follow the step-by-step guide.

#### Step 1: Pre-Production

The pre-production stage is when the planning happens for a video. From creative brainstorming to innovative storyboarding, everything happens here. Pre-production begins with experts getting a feel of your product, who it appeals to, and how it works. Next, is the stage of scripting out your video, writing down the visual ideas, and the product features and dialogue that go alongside it. Finally, you need to round up talents like actors, voice-actors, locations, and extras needed to film.

#### Step 2: Production

Once your lifestyle video is meticulously planned out, your next step is to film it. While shooting an average video takes eight hours, some videos with several locations can require two full shooting days or more. The exact shooting schedule depends on what the script demands.

Since these videos are meant to capture a particular way of life for appealing to a specific kind of person, you should not cut corners in terms of quality. Remember, the better the quality of the footage, the more appealing the end product will be.

#### Step 3: Post-Production

It is the stage where you need to gather the footage you have shot so far and put them along with voice-over or music depending on your script demands. The main goal in this stage is to put the visuals together in a captivating way to promote your service and product. Here, using a powerful video editing tool seems necessary because you need to make your lifestyle video stand out from the crowd.

#### Social Media

Lifestyle videos are aspirational, enlightening in nature, and made to appeal to specific demographics. It makes them great content for sharing on social networking platforms – an active digital marketing channel. Share your lifestyle content across various social media accounts. Ensure you attach a call-to-action for your friends and followers to share.

#### Your Company’s Website

Hosting your promotional videos on your website, particularly your homepage is an excellent way to immediately introduce incoming web traffic to your products and services, thus increasing your site’s SEO ranking. Besides the homepage, sharing the video content on your blogs is another unique way of re-purposing your content.

#### Media Outlets

Find out related media outlets that your potential customers read and follow daily. It would help if you also pitched journalists who take an interest in your brand or consider purchasing advertising space on their website. Since there are both correct and incorrect ways to do so, ensure you conduct thorough research on how to pitch media outlets beforehand.

#### Paid Advertising

You can also pay for featuring your lifestyle video on popular blogs and social networking sites. This way, you can take advantage of hyper-specific tools for reaching your target audience. Advertising on social media platforms like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn is an excellent way to reach the right demographic.

#### Niche Groups & Forums

When targeting a particular demographic, you will want to reach out to where your audience hangs out online. Do research on the industry chat rooms your target demographic frequently uses. While sharing your video content on these channels, just ensure that they are relevant to your potential customer-base, regularly updated, and also includes active users.
