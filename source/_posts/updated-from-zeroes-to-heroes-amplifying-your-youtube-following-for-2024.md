## Part 1: How to Get More Subscribers on YouTube for Beginners

### 1. Be Real and Approachable

You should always be yourself when you vlog. People will subscribe when they feel invested in you as a person, and that happens when they feel like you are being sincere. You do not need to share all of your innermost secrets on your vlog, but you should let your viewers feel like they know you.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2. Don’t forget to add a call to action

Some people need to be prompted to subscribe to your channel, no matter how much they enjoy your content. At the end of all your videos, ask your viewers to subscribe to your channel and like your social media page.

Don’t forget to explain the benefits of subscribing to them, such as to benefit from your informative tips and gain a deeper insight into your projects. If you have any interesting videos in the pipeline, let them know about them.

![call to action](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-to-action-video.JPG)

### 3. Listen To Your Subscribers

It feels nice to get positive comments on your videos. If people feel comfortable enough to leave you suggestions and requests then that is even better. It means that you have succeeded in making them feel like they are part of your community.

If you get a video request, try to do it. People like to feel that you are open to trying the things they want to see. However, there are also times when you should just ignore requests and suggestions. If the majority of your subscribers enjoy your jokes and you get one comment telling you to stop trying to be funny then it is fairly obvious that that ‘suggestion’ does not really reflect the wishes of your community.

![get subscriber](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subscriber02.JPG)

### 4. Optimize your title

Try not to underestimate the importance of a great eye-catching title. Include relevant words and phrases that you think people will search for and don’t just hastily add the first title that comes into your head. The better your title is, the more viewers and subscribers you are likely to amass.

![title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/optimize-title.JPG)

### 5. Be Patient

Almost all vlogs grow slowly at first; the first 1000 subscribers take the longest to get. It takes a lot of patience to keep producing content on a regular schedule when it seems like not many people are watching, but you need to stick with it in order to grow.

### 1. Set goals

You can gain extra drive and momentum by setting yourself attainable goals and encouraging your followers to help you achieve them. These goals can include milestones such as reaching 500 followers, 1,000 followers and so on. Don’t hesitate to tell your viewers about these goals – if they think your content is of real value, chances are they will be only too happy to assist you.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2. Contests can be funny – why not enter one?

One way to increase subscribers is to take part in a contest. A site called Gleam can oversee a contest for you. It’s up to you to choose how you want the contest to work, and you can gain an edge over your competitors by getting people to leave comments, follow you on Instagram, subscribe to your channel and more.

You will be provided with a landing page for promoting your channel, and you can share this in a variety of places, including on your Facebook, Twitter and blog. The best way to heighten your chances of success is to have a clear goal in mind.

![video0 contest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-contest.JPG)

### 3. Make a trailer

YouTube’s channel interface allows you to add a [trailer](https://www.fastcompany.com/3031012/9-short-storytelling-tips-from-a-master-of-movie-trailers) to entice viewers into watching your videos and following you on the platform. Your trailer gives you a valuable opportunity to quickly explain what your channel is all about and what the benefits of following you are.

Don’t waffle on – try to get your clip down to 90 seconds maximum. Include clips from your videos and don’t forget to add a strong call to action at the end. The more effort you put into your videos, the bigger the rewards are likely to become. And here are some of the [best trailer makers that you can use on both Windows and Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

![trailer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-killer-youtube-channel-trailer.jpg)

### 4. Make a Schedule and Stick To It

You want to vlog at least once a week, and making a schedule will help you keep on top of that. It will also give your subscribers a chance to anticipate your videos and get excited. They are more likely to watch an update they have been expecting than one that was not already on their minds.

Sticking to your schedule is a good wait to build up credibility with your audience, but late or skipped updates will cause you to lose that credibility. If you do not post for a month then people who already subscribed to you might still ignore your update because it has been too long and they forgot about you.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 5. Collaborate With Other Vloggers

Collaboration videos are always big hits. When you collaborate with another vlogger you are essentially introducing each other to your subscribers. This is a great way to grow your community quickly: by connecting it to another community.

Collaborations work best when the other vlogger is located close enough to you that you can actually meet up, but you can do distance collaborations too. When you collaborate you and the other vlogger should have close to the same number of subscribers, so the video will benefit you both equally.

## Bonus: How to Get Free YouTube Subscribers \[6 Proven Methods\]

There are lots of ways to get free YouTube subscribers. This proven method involves networking with other creators! Making your presence felt on YouTube is an important part of creating your network of subscribers that watch, share and talk about your videos. Interaction with your subscribers, reaching new audiences every day, and a plethora of other factors influence how well your YouTube channel is doing.

In this part, we will show you how you can build your own network of loyal YouTube supporters and prove that you don't need the services of paid providers who promise better reach for your channel.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1. Find YouTubers in your niche

The first step to building an enviable army of YouTube subscribers starts with the realization that you are not alone. Regardless of the niche, your videos are covering, there are probably thousands of people who are just starting out or that have as many subscribers as your YouTube channel. Focus on finding them. You may even want to make a list.

### 2. Subscribe to YouTube channels you really like

Of the channels you found in Step 1, choose the ones you genuinely like and subscribe to them.

It goes without saying that everyone enjoys support, especially if you are not asking for anything in return. By subscribing to YouTube channels in your genre you appreciate, you will make yourself known to the channel's owner, and there is a chance they will check out and subscribe to your channel.

### 3. Spend time watching videos each day

Knowledge is power and, if you want to attract real people to your channel, you should learn how to use your knowledge to your advantage. By paying attention to other new videos in your genre you’ll gain insight into what is going over well with audiences like yours, and what isn’t.

Also, be especially sure to watch videos from those channels you found in Step 1 and subscribed to in Step 2\. Try to watch at least two minutes of content from those channels whenever they upload.

### 4. Comment thoughtfully. Don’t ask for anything in return

Most YouTubers are delighted to hear someone else's positive opinion or constructive criticism regarding their work. The reason you are watching 2 minutes of content per video in Step 3 is so that you will really have something to say in this step.

If you do make a thoughtful comment, and especially if you use the time stamp of the part of the video you’re referring to, the video creator will know you have watched the video and that you are not just another spammer. Avoid the sub-4-sub strategy, and don't be the person who's always saying 'Subscribe to my channel'. You will be ignored by both the creator and other viewers, and the creator will find you annoying. However, if you comment regularly without asking for anything, the creator and some of their viewers will naturally decide to check out your channel.

### 5. Reach out on social media

YouTube is just one out of many channels through which you can reach like-minded people. Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest or any other social network can help you network with other creators and potential subscribers. Create accounts on social networks you find the most suitable for your video category and share links to your videos on these accounts as often as you can. Furthermore, if you try to foster real discussions about topics that are relevant, people who get to know you through these other platforms will probably decide to check out your YouTube channel.

Social media is also a great place to reach out to other creators, whether it’s for collabs or just to chat about doing YouTube.

### 6. Do it all again. And again. And again

You aren’t going to see great results overnight. You have to spend time almost every day repeating the steps we just described. This might seem intimidating, but as time passes it will become routine.

When you build your presence on YouTube in this way, other creators and their subscribers will naturally start becoming your subscribers. What's your best tip for free YouTube subscribers?

**Conclusion**

Some people might need to watch multiple videos by you before they decide they want to subscribe. If you stop making videos because you did not get any subscribers or comments on your first few then chances are there were people who were paying attention who may have subscribed if you had kept at it.

The most common question is how much YouTubers earn on 100, 1000, or 10,000 views. We're going to answer that question in this article and explain how to calculate YouTube views to money.

First off, we're going to talk about how YouTube works.

Next, we'll examine the importance of YouTube views, plus how to calculate them.

## Part 1: The rules to know for each means earning money from YouTube

As a YouTube creator, finding ways to earn money from your content cannot be easy. Some creators make a living solely off their channels. Others supplement their income with affiliate marketing, sponsorships, and ad revenue. But if you want to earn money from YouTube truly, you need to understand which monetization methods work best for you and your content.

Here's what you should know when using each method and why you should consider doing so:

| **Methods**                                        | **Viewers/Clicks/Impressions**                                     | **Earnings/Commission**                |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **YouTube Ads $1 CPM**                             | 1 million Ad views                                                 | Average rate per ad=0.18Total \~ $5000 |
| **Brand Sponsorships**                             | 5K Sub 5K-30K Sub 30K-500K Sub 500K-1M+ Sub                        | $300 $700 $950 $3500                   |
| **Affiliate Marketing 30%-35% commission**         | If 100 people buys $20 product through affiliate link. Total $2000 | $2000\*35%= $700                       |
| **Crowdfunding (Patreon, Indiegogo, GoFundMe) $5** | 100 subscribers funds the channel                                  | 100\*5=$500                            |
| **Merchandise Shelf $5 Shirt**                     | 100 subscribers purchases your merch                               | 100\*5=$500                            |
| **Channel Memberships $5/month**                   | 100 loyal subscribers join membership                              | 100\*5=$500                            |

### YouTube Ads

The video ads on the platform aren't lucrative and can be used to supplement your income in the form of AdSense earnings. An actual advertiser pays 0.18 per ad view on average (as shown above). That means 1000 ad views equals $18 and $3-$5 per 1000 views.

### Brand Sponsorships

Brands can sponsor your videos to reach their target audience. YouTube videos are a big part of our lives, and brands are becoming increasingly aware of how useful these videos can be. To be eligible for sponsorship, your channel must be of 5000 subscribers.

### Affiliate Marketing

YouTubers help brands increase sales by encouraging their viewers to shop at the company's store or visit its specific product pages. They then earn a commission (30%-35%) on products that people buy after clicking an affiliate link.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Crowdfunding

Today many people use crowdfunding websites to raise money for personal, channel-related projects. Most YouTubers are doing it to generate steady cash flow. Some of them use this source to fund their YouTube videos so that it increases quality and engagement.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Merchandise Shelf

Your merchandise represents and feeds your audience's connection with you. Your product is your business, so you're first and foremost an entrepreneur. Then design your YouTube marketing strategy to sell your merchandise and generate income.

### Channel Membership

YouTube has a plan that allows you to charge your subscribers for membership on your YouTube channel. Members get access to exclusive live chats, badges, emojis, etc. Subscribers must give a set amount every month to a channel that makes a steady monthly income for YouTubers.

## Part 2: Calculate YouTube income by YouTube Money Calculator

How much money do you earn on YouTube? There is no simple way to answer this question, but a YouTube income calculator can give you a rough estimate. It shows you whether you're getting enough money to keep producing videos or if you need to look for additional ways of making money from your channel.

## Part 4: How much money can you make on YouTube?

The answer to that question can vary widely depending on the type of content you produce and the demographics of your target market. However, we've found that a single video ad can be worth anywhere from around $100 to $5,000.

It's safe to say that most YouTubers earn between $1,000 and $10,000 per month from their ads alone. But there are many other factors to take into consideration when calculating the money, you can make on YouTube:

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027209/17108" target="_top" id="2027209"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2027209" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2027209/17108" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### The number of views your videos get

The key to making money from videos on YouTube is views. The more views you have, the more chance of getting paid will increase. So you need to create videos that will get viewers to click.

According to _Forbes's_ estimation, you can make $3-$5 per 1000 views. e.g., a video with 1,000,000 views can make around $5,000 on views only.

### The engagement level of your audience

When building a YouTube channel, the key to success lies in engaging with your audience. After all, if they don't like what you're offering, they will not watch your videos. So you've got to have a message that resonates and is useful.

### Your channel type

The YouTube algorithm is set up to favor channels with a high volume of views per video and high-quality content rather than low-quality channels that generate a lot of traffic but don't produce quality videos. So, if you want to increase your revenue from your YouTube videos, try to focus on high-quality content.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Your monetization method

Several monetization methods exist, including Subscription, advertising, affiliate marketing, paid search, and sponsorships. Each monetization method requires a slightly different setup and management, resulting in different revenue.

### The country you are in

It is important to know that in some countries, making money off YouTube is extremely difficult. For example, in certain countries, monetizing your videos is impossible without using illegal methods, which will get you into legal trouble.

Some other factors, e.g., it's worth comparing the RPM of your country and other countries, different rules and prices of YouTube Ads depending on your country.

Part 1: The rules to know for each means earning money from YouTube

As a YouTube creator, finding ways to earn money from your content cannot be easy. Some creators make a living solely off their channels. Others supplement their income with affiliate marketing, sponsorships, and ad revenue. But if you want to earn money from YouTube truly, you need to understand which monetization methods work best for you and your content.

Here's what you should know when using each method and why you should consider doing so:

| **Methods**                                        | **Viewers/Clicks/Impressions**                                     | **Earnings/Commission**                |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **YouTube Ads $1 CPM**                             | 1 million Ad views                                                 | Average rate per ad=0.18Total \~ $5000 |
| **Brand Sponsorships**                             | 5K Sub 5K-30K Sub 30K-500K Sub 500K-1M+ Sub                        | $300 $700 $950 $3500                   |
| **Affiliate Marketing 30%-35% commission**         | If 100 people buys $20 product through affiliate link. Total $2000 | $2000\*35%= $700                       |
| **Crowdfunding (Patreon, Indiegogo, GoFundMe) $5** | 100 subscribers funds the channel                                  | 100\*5=$500                            |
| **Merchandise Shelf $5 Shirt**                     | 100 subscribers purchases your merch                               | 100\*5=$500                            |
| **Channel Memberships $5/month**                   | 100 loyal subscribers join membership                              | 100\*5=$500                            |

### YouTube Ads

The video ads on the platform aren't lucrative and can be used to supplement your income in the form of AdSense earnings. An actual advertiser pays 0.18 per ad view on average (as shown above). That means 1000 ad views equals $18 and $3-$5 per 1000 views.

### Brand Sponsorships

Brands can sponsor your videos to reach their target audience. YouTube videos are a big part of our lives, and brands are becoming increasingly aware of how useful these videos can be. To be eligible for sponsorship, your channel must be of 5000 subscribers.

### Affiliate Marketing

YouTubers help brands increase sales by encouraging their viewers to shop at the company's store or visit its specific product pages. They then earn a commission (30%-35%) on products that people buy after clicking an affiliate link.

### Crowdfunding

Today many people use crowdfunding websites to raise money for personal, channel-related projects. Most YouTubers are doing it to generate steady cash flow. Some of them use this source to fund their YouTube videos so that it increases quality and engagement.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Channel Membership

YouTube has a plan that allows you to charge your subscribers for membership on your YouTube channel. Members get access to exclusive live chats, badges, emojis, etc. Subscribers must give a set amount every month to a channel that makes a steady monthly income for YouTubers.

## Part 4: How much money can you make on YouTube?

The answer to that question can vary widely depending on the type of content you produce and the demographics of your target market. However, we've found that a single video ad can be worth anywhere from around $100 to $5,000.

It's safe to say that most YouTubers earn between $1,000 and $10,000 per month from their ads alone. But there are many other factors to take into consideration when calculating the money, you can make on YouTube:

### The number of views your videos get

The key to making money from videos on YouTube is views. The more views you have, the more chance of getting paid will increase. So you need to create videos that will get viewers to click.

According to _Forbes's_ estimation, you can make $3-$5 per 1000 views. e.g., a video with 1,000,000 views can make around $5,000 on views only.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### The engagement level of your audience

When building a YouTube channel, the key to success lies in engaging with your audience. After all, if they don't like what you're offering, they will not watch your videos. So you've got to have a message that resonates and is useful.

### Your channel type

The YouTube algorithm is set up to favor channels with a high volume of views per video and high-quality content rather than low-quality channels that generate a lot of traffic but don't produce quality videos. So, if you want to increase your revenue from your YouTube videos, try to focus on high-quality content.

### Your monetization method

Several monetization methods exist, including Subscription, advertising, affiliate marketing, paid search, and sponsorships. Each monetization method requires a slightly different setup and management, resulting in different revenue.

### The country you are in

It is important to know that in some countries, making money off YouTube is extremely difficult. For example, in certain countries, monetizing your videos is impossible without using illegal methods, which will get you into legal trouble.

Some other factors, e.g., it's worth comparing the RPM of your country and other countries, different rules and prices of YouTube Ads depending on your country.
