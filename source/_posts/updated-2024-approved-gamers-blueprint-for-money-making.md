## Part 2: Techno Gamerz YouTube Earning and Stats

Ujjwal Chaurasia, alias Techno Gamerz, was born and grew up in New Delhi, India. The charismatic vlogger first joined YouTube on August 13, 2017, and uploaded his first gaming video on January 2018\. Initially, Ujjwal used his elder brother's phone to post gaming tutorial videos. This obviously limited his input on YouTube as he also had to set aside time for studying.

![techno gamerz youtube marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-2.jpg)

But after seeing potential in what Techno Gamerz was doing, his brother encouraged him to post more often. His first viral video was for Dragon Ball Z, a downloading tutorial.

Remember that there are some conditions to meet before you start earning money on YouTube. First, the channel must be active for at least a year and have a minimum of 1,000 subscribers. That's not all; you'll need nothing less than 4,000 watch hours to be on YouTube's payroll.

| Subscribers                                     | 29 million       |
