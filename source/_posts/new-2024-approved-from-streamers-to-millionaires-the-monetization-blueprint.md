## Enhancing Video Tracking: Adding Timestamps in YouTube

# How to Add Timestamps on YouTube Video Link?

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

##### Richard Bennett

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

It is a well-known fact that internet users have a short interest span, about just eight seconds. This attention span applies to all internet platforms including YouTube. YouTube is the second largest and most visited search engine after Google. It provides users with information through engaging and eye-catchy videos. However, certain videos are longer where only a particular section of the video holds the important information. Viewers tend to skip the long videos and if you do not want this to happen to you, you can link to that specific part on your video adding value for your channel viewers with a link known as the YouTube Timestamp link.

When you have a Timestamp link on your video, you can help your viewers directly reach the specific time in the video. This helps avoid the viewers from losing interest or to search for the key part in your video themselves.

Here in this article, we will explain Timestamp links, how to add Timestamp to YouTube video links, and what are the benefits of Timestamp.

* [Part 1: YouTube Timestamp Links Introduction](#part1)
* [Part 2: Adding a Timestamp to YouTube Video Link on Desktop](#part2)
* [Part 3: How to Share Specific Parts of YouTube Video](#part3)
* [part 4: Getting YouTube Timestamp Link on Mobile](#part4)
* [Part 5: FAQ About YouTube Timestamps](#part5)

## Part 1: What is YouTube Timestamp Links

In this fast-paced world where viewers have limited time at hand, YouTube Timestamp links are extremely helpful. These links are anchor text or video hyperlinks found either in the description beneath the video or at the video link end.

![ youtube timestamps in google serp ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-timestamp-google-serp.jpg)

The Timestamps links allow you to put a link to a key moment in your YouTube video allowing the viewers and subscribers to view the video at the precise time specified. Your YouTube video maybe half an hour long or maybe your users do not have the time now or forget to later watch your video, but when you add Timestamp to the YouTube link, you provide them ways to get to the content quickly enhancing the user experience.

In addition to this, you can even provide a reference in minutes and hours where necessary. The YouTube Timestamp link acts as a guide that directs viewers to the part of the video, which is most relevant to them without having to watch the entire video.

## Part 2: How to Add a Timestamp to YouTube Video Link on Desktop?

In the following section, I will show you how to add timestamp to YouTube video link in several ways.

**Use YouTube's Share Feature**

Using YouTube’s share feature is the simplest way to add Timestamp to YouTube videos. Here are easy steps to follow to do this.

1. Open the YouTube video on your desktop that you want to share.
2. Play the video or navigate the timeline and stop at the key moment you wish to apply the timestamp to.
3. Now click on the Share button, a pop-up will appear. Under the URL, you will see a small box indicating Start at. The Timestamp is generated automatically, but you can adjust it.

![ youtube timestamps link ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-youtube-timestamp-link.jpg)

1. Copy the updated URL with Timestamp to share the video or click on the social sharing icons to do so.
2. When your viewers click on this URL, the video will begin at the specified Timestamp.

**Use the Browser URL to add Timestamp manually**

You can add Timestamp manually as well. Follow the step-by-step guide below to add a Timestamp manually.

1. Open your YouTube video in a browser on your desktop and then find the URL in the browser’s address bar.
2. Enter the specific time you want the viewers to watch the video from at the end of the video URL.

You can add time manually in two ways depending on the URL.

?t=As or

&t=As

**“youtu.be/” Format**

If your YouTube video link is a youtu.be format, then just add ?t=As at the end of the video link. The A denotes the seconds at which you want the viewer to watch your video. The time can also be specified in minutes and seconds and when you want to do that just add ?t=AmBs. For instance, ?t=2m40s.

**“youtube.com/” Format**

When your YouTube video link has a youtube.com format, the adjustment starts with an ampersand. &t=As or &t=AmBs is what you can use. If you are looking to add the Timestamp at 2m40s, just add “&t=2m40s at the end of the video URL.

Whenever anybody uses the URL with Timestamp, the video will start from the specified time.

However, when adding a Timestamp manually, always leave include whole numbers. For example, if the time starts at 4m, use 4 and not 04.

**Copy video URL at current time**

You can use YouTube’s built-in feature to share the key parts of your YouTube video. Follow the steps here.

1. Visit YouTube and open the video you want to add Timestamp link to.
2. Play the video or navigate the timeline to reach the specific part you like to use in Timestamp.
3. Now either press Ctrl + click or right-click anywhere on the video. A pop-up opens where you can see various texts, click on the **Copy video URL at current time** and share the link.

![ get youtube timestamps link ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/copy-video-url-at-current-time.jpg)

1. Anyone who clicks on this link will be instantly transported to the exact segment of your YouTube video.

## Part 3: How to Share Specific Parts of Videos with Vibby and Get YouTube Link with Timestamp

The above-mentioned methods to add and send YouTube link with timestamp are quick and easy, but they have a few limitations. If you need more control and share highlighted parts of YouTube video without cutting the video, you need to use a third-party tool known as Vibby.

Vibby allows you to not only share specific parts of videos from YouTube but other platforms as well like Vimeo and Twitch. With the tool, you can clip multiple sections of the video and share them with others.

1. To get started, signup either with mail, Google, Twitter, Facebook, or Twitch account.
