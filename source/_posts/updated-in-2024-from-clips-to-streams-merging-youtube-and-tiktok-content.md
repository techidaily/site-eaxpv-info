## Part 1: How to Link a YouTube Video to TikTok Post?

There is no social network available online that gives more relevancy, popularity, and engagement than TikTok. Even though Tiktok's operations were only launched outside of China a few years ago, Tiktok has entirely taken over the social sphere when it comes to producing amusing and enjoyable short videos, which has been seen after a very long time after the app 'VINE' was shut down back in 2016.

You can reap multiple benefits if you're a content creator by connecting all your social media platforms. You can extend your reach and exposure to an immense number of people by linking your YouTube video to the TikTok post. Let's look at your options of connecting videos from **YouTube to TikTok** and highlight h**ow to connect TikTok to YouTube.**

Step 1: Open the TikTok app on your phone and tap on your **profile** option.

Step 2: Tap on the **edit profile** option and further select **Add YouTube to Your Profile** option.

Note: If you haven't previously linked your YouTube account to your TikTok channel, tapping on this will very certainly take you to another page with the **Google login screen**.

Step 3: Click on **"Allow" option**. By tapping on this, your YouTube channel will display as a link in your bio area.

Note: However, as we continue with this knowledge, it is worth noting that when you put your channel description and links under the videos you publish, the link is not **always clickable**.

Further, we feel that differences in posting (such as formats, [aspect ratios](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and durations) should be accounted for when YouTube videos are converted into TikTok videos. Tiktok offers a 9:16 aspect ratio compared to most videos on YouTube, where the aspect ratio is primarily 16:9.

As for the format, the resolution can only be set to 1080p since TikTok only supports it to utilize the entire canvas. Tiktok is a platform that promotes videos ranging from 15 seconds to 3 minutes, compared to its initial support for content up to 15 seconds only. You will most likely have to resize your video if you plan to share it on Tiktok with all the above elements. Here are some of the video dimension details for TikTok.

Instagram stars, YouTube stars, and even real-life movie stars have switched to this platform, so what's stopping you? It has so much to offer. Both seem to work in a connected way as Tiktok stars are seen converting videos from **YouTube to TikTok.**

## Part 1: How to Link a YouTube Video to TikTok Post?

There is no social network available online that gives more relevancy, popularity, and engagement than TikTok. Even though Tiktok's operations were only launched outside of China a few years ago, Tiktok has entirely taken over the social sphere when it comes to producing amusing and enjoyable short videos, which has been seen after a very long time after the app 'VINE' was shut down back in 2016.

You can reap multiple benefits if you're a content creator by connecting all your social media platforms. You can extend your reach and exposure to an immense number of people by linking your YouTube video to the TikTok post. Let's look at your options of connecting videos from **YouTube to TikTok** and highlight h**ow to connect TikTok to YouTube.**

Step 1: Open the TikTok app on your phone and tap on your **profile** option.

Step 2: Tap on the **edit profile** option and further select **Add YouTube to Your Profile** option.

Note: If you haven't previously linked your YouTube account to your TikTok channel, tapping on this will very certainly take you to another page with the **Google login screen**.

Step 3: Click on **"Allow" option**. By tapping on this, your YouTube channel will display as a link in your bio area.

Note: However, as we continue with this knowledge, it is worth noting that when you put your channel description and links under the videos you publish, the link is not **always clickable**. It is recommended that you keep with the bio section and conclude your short films by urging your viewers to visit your YouTube channel, which is included in the bio of your Tiktok profile.

## Part 2: How to Convert YouTube Video and Post to TikTok? \[3 ways\]

Further, we feel that differences in posting (such as formats, [aspect ratios](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and durations) should be accounted for when YouTube videos are converted into TikTok videos. Tiktok offers a 9:16 aspect ratio compared to most videos on YouTube, where the aspect ratio is primarily 16:9.

As for the format, the resolution can only be set to 1080p since TikTok only supports it to utilize the entire canvas. Tiktok is a platform that promotes videos ranging from 15 seconds to 3 minutes, compared to its initial support for content up to 15 seconds only. You will most likely have to resize your video if you plan to share it on Tiktok with all the above elements. Here are some of the video dimension details for TikTok.

* **Dimensions:** 1080 x 1920
* **Resolution:** 9:16 Aspect Ratio
* **File Format:**.mp4 or .mov
* **Code**:  encoded

We might have left you perplexed with all the information about **how to connect TikTok to YouTube**, but don't worry, here are a variety of apps and a step-by-step guide for posting your videos on Tiktok without any issues.

### 1\. Kapwing Studio

Within the various applications available, [Kapwing Studio](https://www.kapwing.com/studio) provides users with support and resources to help them edit and convert their YouTube videos to TikTok.
