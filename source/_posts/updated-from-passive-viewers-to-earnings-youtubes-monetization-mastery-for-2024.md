Want to make money on YouTube? There are qualifications you have to meet before you can monetize your videos with ads, but you don’t have to have a huge channel.

Here’s everything you need to know to join the YouTube Partner Program and start earning ad revenue:

1. [Qualifying for the YouTube Partner Program](#qualify)
2. [How to Apply for Monetization on YouTube](#apply)
3. [What is Ad Friendly Content?](#adfriendly)
4. [How to Get Paid Through AdSense](#getpaid)
5. [Which YouTube Videos Get the Highest Paying Ads?](#highestpaid)
6. [Useful Terminology (CPM, CPV, CPC)](#terminology)

#### **What is the YouTube Partner Program**

YouTube’s Partner Program, or YPP, allows creators to monetize their YouTube videos through ads. If you are a YouTube Partner, that means you are earning revenue from the ads being shown before and during your videos.

Before you dive into the below guide, you may need a video editor to start your monetizing on Youtube. Filmora video editor will be the best choice.

Becoming a skilled video editor takes years of practice, but with Wondershare Filmora video editor, you can produce YouTube videos that have a professional look and feel, even if you are new to the world of video editing.

## **Qualifying for the YouTube Partner Program**

In order to qualify for YPP, you need to prove that you’re creating consistent, original, content and that people are watching your content. YouTube believes that has been proven when you reach these qualifications:

1. 1000 Subscribers
2. 4000 Hours of Watch Time (over the past 12 months)

Not quite there yet? Here’s a list of actionable tips that can help you [**grow your channel**](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/27-fun-and-easy-tactics-to-get-more-youtube-subscribers-405.html).

If you meet these requirements and are approved for monetization, but then drop below them, your channel will not be automatically demonetized. YouTube may review your content and demonetize you if you seem to have stopped posting videos, but this will not be automatic.

Remember: meeting these milestones does not grant you automatic monetization.

You can apply for YPP when you reach the milestones above, but your channel will still need to be reviewed by a human working for YouTube. Reviewers will be watching for:

1. Nudity or sexual content
2. Harmful, dangerous, threatening, or hateful content
3. Violent or graphic content
4. Harassment or cyberbullying
5. Spam, scams, and misleading metadata
6. Copyright infringement or impersonation
7. Privacy violations
8. Fake subscribers
9. Other guidelines violations

If your content violates any of YouTube’s Community Guidelines you may be denied monetization. Learn more about [**YouTube’s Community Guidelines here**](https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/policies/#community-guidelines).

## **How to Apply for Monetization on YouTube**

Once you qualify for YPP, applying for monetization is easy.

1. In the Creator Studio, select Channel > Status and features.
2. Under ‘Monetization’, click Enable and follow the steps that appear to accept YouTube’s terms.
3. Wait to be approved.

If you’re approved, you can start earning money as soon as your AdSense account is set up!

If you’re not approved, you can apply again in 30 days.

To make sure you’re approved the next time you apply, review all of YouTube’s related policies ([Partner Program policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392), [Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms), [spam policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801973), and [Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/policies/)) and remove the content that might be holding you back.

In order to start monetizing, you’ll need to link your channel with an AdSense account. You must be over 18 to create an AdSense account. YouTube creators under 18 can link to the AdSense accounts of their parents or guardians.

Here’s how to sign up for AdSense through YouTube:

1. Under **Channel >** **Status and features** in your **Creator Studio**, look for Paid content. Click where it says **‘active AdSense account’**.
2. On the following ‘Monetization’ screen, click **Next** to go to AdSense.
3. You will be asked whether you want to use the Google account you’re already signed in to for AdSense, or if you want to use a different account.
4. The next step is ‘Your Website’. This will automatically be filled in with your channel. Click **Accept association** if it’s right.

**Note:** you can only have one AdSense account. Do not make a second one if you already have one. Duplicate accounts may be banned, which will stop you from monetizing your videos.

## **What is Ad Friendly content?**

Not all content that meets YouTube’s Community Guidelines will be considered ‘advertiser-friendly’. Companies don’t want to run ads alongside content that doesn’t match the values of their brands.

YouTube may disable ads on any video it doesn’t think is ad-friendly. Videos which may be flagged as inappropriate for ads include (but are not limited to):

1. Videos that cover controversial or sensitive subjects.
2. Videos depicting the use of drugs or dangerous products.
3. Videos may encourage harmful or dangerous behavior.
4. Videos with swearing (but not ALL videos with swearing – quantity and context are factors).
5. Videos which contain hate speech.
6. Videos that depict family entertainment characters (i.e. Disney princesses) engaged in inappropriate behavior (even if you’re being satirical).

If you want to make sure all of your content is advertiser-friendly, here are some best practices suggested by YouTube:

1. Be respectful of your viewers and any people or groups you may include or mention in your video.
2. Extend this respectful tone to your thumbnails and video titles, and make sure your thumbnails and metadata accurately depict your video’s content.
3. Don’t try to monetize videos that already contain ads (i.e. [paid product placement](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/154235)).

## **How to Get Paid Through AdSense**

In order to receive a payment from AdSense, you need to earn at least $100\.

For example, if you only earn $10 in a month, you will not receive a payment that month. You will not lose that $10 – you will receive it when your total earnings reach or exceed $100\.

You will also need to provide AdSense with tax information and verify your identity and address in order to start being paid.

The most popular way to get paid through AdSense is via an EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer). To receive your payments this way, you’ll need to link your bank account to your AdSense account.

Here’s how:

1. Log in to [**AdSense**](https://www.google.com/AdSense).
2. Click **Settings** in the menu on the left, and then select **Payments**.
3. On the Payments page, click **Manage payment options**.
4. Click the **Add payment method**.
5. You’ll be prompted to add your bank account details.
6. Make sure the name on your AdSense account matches the name on your bank account (if you’re under 18 and cannot make your own AdSense account, this may mean you’re using your parent or guardian’s bank account).

## **Which YouTube Videos Get the Highest Paying Ads?**

Not all ads pay the same, and not all videos will be able to attract the ads that pay the most.

How much money your video has the potential to earn depends on:

1. The size of your channel
2. Your niche on YouTube
3. The specific topic of the video

That the size of your channel matters probably isn’t a surprise. The biggest brands want to run their ads beside videos that are getting more views.

Whether or not your YouTube niche has a high potential for profit will depend on a couple things:

1. **How many other channels are in your niche?**

The more people there are making similar videos to you, the thinner the available ads are spread.

1. **How many cheap or expensive products are being advertised in your niche?**

If the products are free or inexpensive (i.e. free online games) then that limits your earning ability. In large niches like gaming, the few higher paying ads will go to the most popular channels and the low-paying ads will be spread amongst everyone else.

If you have a very specific niche, i.e. luxury cars, then you will have less competition and the ads available will likely be for more expensive products (and thus the ads themselves will be higher paying).

Even if you are in a large niche, you can still make videos on specific topics designed to attract higher-paying ads and more revenue. Pay attention to the analytics in your Creator Studio to learn which of your videos earn the most. Then, make more videos on similar topics to boost your earnings.

Another factor that can affect what ads appear alongside your videos is the viewing habits of individual viewers. People are shown ads that YouTube believes are more relevant to their interests.

## **Useful Terminology (CPM, CPC, CPV)**

A lot of people think your ad revenue is determined by your view count. This isn’t true – it’s determined by ad impressions.

How much revenue you earn from the ads running around your videos depends on these three things:

**CPC:** ‘cost per click’. Most of the ads on YouTube are CPC, meaning that an ad impression is only recorded when an ad is clicked on.

**CPV:** ‘cost per view’. Skippable pre-roll ads are the only ads on YouTube which record ad impressions without clicks. These ads record ad impressions when viewers watch 30 seconds of the ad instead of skipping it.

**CPM:** ‘cost per mille’ or ‘cost per thousand’. This refers to how much money gets paid out for 1000 ad impressions.

Your CPM will be affected by a multitude of things including the ads themselves and the size of your channel. AdSense has made it a rule that you cannot disclose your CPM to anyone, which makes it difficult to determine what you should expect.

**Note:** never click on ads near your own videos or instruct your viewers/friends to do so. If your clicks are higher than what AdSense considers normal they may ban you.

Sites like [**Social Blade**](https://socialblade.com/) provide estimated earnings for any channel you want to look up. Looking up channels that are where you plan to be in the near future could help you set your own expectations.

Are you able to monetize your videos? How many more subscribers or hours of watch time do you need?

Many people have a strong desire to make videos. Whether you make videos for a living or as a pastime, it doesn't matter. When you make a fantastic film that you're pleased with, you want to show it off to your friends and family. YouTube, the most popular site for sharing videos on various themes, is one of the most incredible places to start.

YouTube is fantastic for sharing videos, but it can be harsh on artists due to the high bar for content and video quality. If you want to succeed as a YouTuber, you must create videos that are informative and high-resolution. This is critical since your viewers may wish to watch your movies on a computer screen or a 4K smart TV.

If you've decided to make videos in 4K resolution, you'll find information on recommended encoding settings, how to upload a video to YouTube, potential problems, and more below.

01 [What Is The Distinction Between Various Resolutions?](#part1)

02 [Why Would You Want To Upload A 4k Video?](#part2)

03 [What Is The Best Way To Upload A 4k Video To Youtube?](#part3)

04 [Tips On How To Make Sure The Video You're Uploading Is Of High Quality](#part4)

## What Is The Distinction Between Various Resolutions?

The number of pixels on a screen is referred to as resolution. Low resolution indicates fewer pixels and typically less space, whereas high resolution means more pixels and generally greater space and detail. You probably have a poor resolution if you're using a standard laptop or an old screen.

When watching a video on a larger screen, the resolution significantly impacts your viewing experience. Whether it's a live stream or an on-demand movie, the correct resolution is crucial to reaching a wider audience, and this is where iPhones and iPads appear to have an advantage. Let's take a closer look at each of these resolution types and their associated pixel sizes.

#### 1\. SD RESOLUTION (STANDARD DEFINITION)

Previously, resolutions were separated into SD (Standard Definition) and HD (High Definition) categories. SD was defined as a video with a resolution of less than 720p. However, as television and computer monitor display resolutions improved over time, a video was less likely to be shot in Standard Definition.

The following are the most common standard video resolutions:

* 640 × 360 pixels (or 360p)
* 640 × 480 pixels (or 480p)

#### 2\. RESOLUTION: 720P HD (HIGH DEFINITION)

The lowest video resolution is 720p, which is commonly referred to as 'HD.' 720p (1280 x 720 pixels) is a resolution recognized for modest web content, even though most videos require at least 1080p. Because most computer monitors are now in HD, the recommended practice for web and streaming is to choose a resolution higher than 720p.

The resolution of HD videos is usually: 1280 x 720 pixels (or 720p)

#### 3\. 1080P FULL HD RESOLUTION

1080p resolutions, also known as 'Full HD,' have become the industry standard for a clear HD video that doesn't take up a lot of storage space. It's also worth noting that this is the standard screen resolution for all smartphones.

The resolution of full HD videos is usually: 1920 x 1080 pixels (or 1080p)

#### 4\. 2K RESOLUTION WITH QHD (QUAD HIGH DEFINITION)

Quad HD resolution, or QHD for short, is widely found on high-end smartphones and gaming monitors. The resolution of 1440p is four times that of HD Ready (or 720p HD). Many high-end smartphones have a Quad HD+ resolution (296 x 1440 pixels), which is ideal for 1440p. Another common screen resolution is 2K, which allows for larger displays and reframing without sacrificing quality or image editing.

The resolution of QHD and 2K videos is:

* 2560 x 1440 pixels in QHD (or 1440p)
* 2048 x 1080 pixels in 2K (or 1080p)

#### 5\. 4K (OR UHD/ULTRA-HIGH-DEFINITION) RESOLUTION

This sort of resolution, often known as 4Kor UHD (Ultra High Definition), has a pixel size of 3840 x 2160 pixels. It has a similar appearance to 2K, but it provides video artists more room to edit and zoom in. For vivid color, graphics, or dramatic viewing, both 2K and 4K resolutions are available. Unless you wish to tweak colors or trim in closer, there aren't enough visible distinctions between 2K and 4K. So, it matters when you want to change a certain detail, but it doesn't matter when someone else is looking at it.

The resolution of 4K videos is: 3840 x 2160 (or 2160p / simply 4K) is a resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels.

## Why Would You Want To Upload A 4k Video?

YouTube is the second-largest social media site, with approximately 1.9 billion monthly active users. YouTube is where you want to be to access this large audience and promote your brand, with one billion hours of video watched every day on the platform.

However, for your target audience to watch your videos, you must ensure excellent video quality. Poorly shot or edited films may alienate your viewers, especially when there are billions of other videos to choose from on the site.

* 4k is the most satisfactory resolution for uploading to YouTube. Although not every viewer can watch videos in 4k, it ensures that your visitors get the best possible experience.
* Traditional Full HD (1920 x 1080) TVs feature four times as many pixels as 4K TVs. Because of the higher pixel density, the picture quality of 4K TVs is more colorful and detailed, even on TV displays of the same size. This distinction is most noticeable on large-screen televisions.
* Even if you recorded in 1080p and upscaled to 4K, you should post in 4K to YouTube for the finest image quality. Recording in 1080p, editing in 1080p, exporting in 4k, and YouTube viewing is sharper in 1080p.
* With 4K, you get stunning visuals with a resolution of 38402160, which is four times that of Full-HD. That's why visuals appear crisp and lifelike, even on large-screen TVs rather than pixelated. Down-converted 4K to Full-HD photographs have superior quality and resolution than images shot in Full-HD from the start.

## What Is The Best Way To Upload A 4k Video To Youtube?

The YouTube upload process is not complicated, but it does need several steps. You can finally post your video once it has been prepared and converted to MP4 format.

Follow the steps below to post your video to YouTube:

1\. Go to YouTube.com in your browser.

2\. Log in to your account and click the "Create" symbol, which looks like a camera with a plus sign, in the right corner of the menu bar.

3\. Select "Upload video" from the drop-down menu.

![upload 4k video to youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-4k-video-to-youtube-1.jpg)

4\. Drag and drop your video file into the upload box, or select your file from the "Select File" menu and click "Open."

5\. Make a note of the title and description while YouTube is processing your video.

![how to upload 4k video to youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-4k-video-to-youtube-2.jpg)

6\. Select a video thumbnail from the options or upload your own and select your "Audience" from the drop-down menu. To manage age restriction settings.

7\. Select "More Options" to add searchable keywords to your video, manage subtitles and comments, and more.

![upload 4k video to youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-4k-video-to-youtube-3.jpg)

8\. Select if you want to add promotions to your video by clicking "Next."

9\. Finally, click "Next" and wait for the video to be processed entirely before publishing it.

10\. You can also automatically set it to publish at a later date.

## Tips On How To Make Sure The Video You're Uploading Is Of High Quality

The following are five tips for amateur and top newbie YouTubers who want to improve their videos.

#### 1\. Cut Your Video Into Clips And Organize It

While it may appear to be the simplest solution to perform an entire video at once, this might make the process tedious or even damage your video if you are interrupted or make a speech error. Smaller video segments are easier to edit and blend into a single, well-formatted video.

#### 2\. Youtube Video Export

You can also modify your videos in various formats to your heart's content before exporting them to YouTube and publishing them. Although uploading and exporting may take some time, the quality of your video will significantly increase, and the time and work you put in will be evident.

#### 3\. Change Up Your Shots

Rather than keeping your camera fixed, try varied angles while shooting. This may not work for all of your videos, but it is critical to keep your viewers engaged while they watch them, especially if you want them to stay until the finish and come back for more. Unless you're talking about anything incredibly essential, sitting and listening to someone talk for more than 10 minutes without the camera moving will quickly become dull or old.

#### 4\. Transitions And Effects

When editing a video with numerous parts, the use of effects and transitions can considerably impact the overall quality of the video. Filmora is far more sophisticated than Windows Movie Maker and iMovie on Mac. It also allows you to create a professional-looking YouTube video with hundreds of presets such as filters, overlays, components, transitions, and blending several layers of effects and audio to enhance your YouTube tale.

Wondershare Filmii is one of the greatest choices for Windows for beginners who wish to create video footage with templates automatically. Smart video templates, trendy filters and overlays, fun stickers and motion components, and, most importantly, advanced editing capabilities are all available.

## Conclusion

**●** This is pretty much everything we've gathered to assist you in uploading 4K videos to YouTube. Do not become worried. Your 4K video will be in low resolution when you first publish it. This is due to YouTube's high-resolution processing requiring time. It could take a few hours for your video to be available in 4K mode.

**●** The duration, format, frame rate, and resolution of your video all affect the processing time for high-definition videos. If you don't want your video to be seen unless it has a high-quality option, upload it as unlisted and then publish it once 4K resolution is available.

## Tips On How To Make Sure The Video You're Uploading Is Of High Quality

The following are five tips for amateur and top newbie YouTubers who want to improve their videos.

#### 1\. Cut Your Video Into Clips And Organize It

While it may appear to be the simplest solution to perform an entire video at once, this might make the process tedious or even damage your video if you are interrupted or make a speech error. Smaller video segments are easier to edit and blend into a single, well-formatted video.

#### 2\. Youtube Video Export

You can also modify your videos in various formats to your heart's content before exporting them to YouTube and publishing them. Although uploading and exporting may take some time, the quality of your video will significantly increase, and the time and work you put in will be evident.

#### 3\. Change Up Your Shots

Rather than keeping your camera fixed, try varied angles while shooting. This may not work for all of your videos, but it is critical to keep your viewers engaged while they watch them, especially if you want them to stay until the finish and come back for more. Unless you're talking about anything incredibly essential, sitting and listening to someone talk for more than 10 minutes without the camera moving will quickly become dull or old.

#### 4\. Transitions And Effects

When editing a video with numerous parts, the use of effects and transitions can considerably impact the overall quality of the video. Filmora is far more sophisticated than Windows Movie Maker and iMovie on Mac. It also allows you to create a professional-looking YouTube video with hundreds of presets such as filters, overlays, components, transitions, and blending several layers of effects and audio to enhance your YouTube tale.

Wondershare Filmii is one of the greatest choices for Windows for beginners who wish to create video footage with templates automatically. Smart video templates, trendy filters and overlays, fun stickers and motion components, and, most importantly, advanced editing capabilities are all available.

## Conclusion

**●** This is pretty much everything we've gathered to assist you in uploading 4K videos to YouTube. Do not become worried. Your 4K video will be in low resolution when you first publish it. This is due to YouTube's high-resolution processing requiring time. It could take a few hours for your video to be available in 4K mode.

**●** The duration, format, frame rate, and resolution of your video all affect the processing time for high-definition videos. If you don't want your video to be seen unless it has a high-quality option, upload it as unlisted and then publish it once 4K resolution is available.

Many people have a strong desire to make videos. Whether you make videos for a living or as a pastime, it doesn't matter. When you make a fantastic film that you're pleased with, you want to show it off to your friends and family. YouTube, the most popular site for sharing videos on various themes, is one of the most incredible places to start.

YouTube is fantastic for sharing videos, but it can be harsh on artists due to the high bar for content and video quality. If you want to succeed as a YouTuber, you must create videos that are informative and high-resolution. This is critical since your viewers may wish to watch your movies on a computer screen or a 4K smart TV.

If you've decided to make videos in 4K resolution, you'll find information on recommended encoding settings, how to upload a video to YouTube, potential problems, and more below.

## What Is The Distinction Between Various Resolutions?

The number of pixels on a screen is referred to as resolution. Low resolution indicates fewer pixels and typically less space, whereas high resolution means more pixels and generally greater space and detail. You probably have a poor resolution if you're using a standard laptop or an old screen.

When watching a video on a larger screen, the resolution significantly impacts your viewing experience. Whether it's a live stream or an on-demand movie, the correct resolution is crucial to reaching a wider audience, and this is where iPhones and iPads appear to have an advantage. Let's take a closer look at each of these resolution types and their associated pixel sizes.

#### 1\. SD RESOLUTION (STANDARD DEFINITION)

Previously, resolutions were separated into SD (Standard Definition) and HD (High Definition) categories. SD was defined as a video with a resolution of less than 720p. However, as television and computer monitor display resolutions improved over time, a video was less likely to be shot in Standard Definition.

The following are the most common standard video resolutions:

* 640 × 360 pixels (or 360p)
* 640 × 480 pixels (or 480p)

#### 2\. RESOLUTION: 720P HD (HIGH DEFINITION)

The lowest video resolution is 720p, which is commonly referred to as 'HD.' 720p (1280 x 720 pixels) is a resolution recognized for modest web content, even though most videos require at least 1080p. Because most computer monitors are now in HD, the recommended practice for web and streaming is to choose a resolution higher than 720p.

The resolution of HD videos is usually: 1280 x 720 pixels (or 720p)

#### 3\. 1080P FULL HD RESOLUTION

1080p resolutions, also known as 'Full HD,' have become the industry standard for a clear HD video that doesn't take up a lot of storage space. It's also worth noting that this is the standard screen resolution for all smartphones.

The resolution of full HD videos is usually: 1920 x 1080 pixels (or 1080p)

#### 4\. 2K RESOLUTION WITH QHD (QUAD HIGH DEFINITION)

Quad HD resolution, or QHD for short, is widely found on high-end smartphones and gaming monitors. The resolution of 1440p is four times that of HD Ready (or 720p HD). Many high-end smartphones have a Quad HD+ resolution (296 x 1440 pixels), which is ideal for 1440p. Another common screen resolution is 2K, which allows for larger displays and reframing without sacrificing quality or image editing.

The resolution of QHD and 2K videos is:

* 2560 x 1440 pixels in QHD (or 1440p)
* 2048 x 1080 pixels in 2K (or 1080p)

#### 5\. 4K (OR UHD/ULTRA-HIGH-DEFINITION) RESOLUTION

This sort of resolution, often known as 4Kor UHD (Ultra High Definition), has a pixel size of 3840 x 2160 pixels. It has a similar appearance to 2K, but it provides video artists more room to edit and zoom in. For vivid color, graphics, or dramatic viewing, both 2K and 4K resolutions are available. Unless you wish to tweak colors or trim in closer, there aren't enough visible distinctions between 2K and 4K. So, it matters when you want to change a certain detail, but it doesn't matter when someone else is looking at it.

The resolution of 4K videos is: 3840 x 2160 (or 2160p / simply 4K) is a resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels.

## Why Would You Want To Upload A 4k Video?

YouTube is the second-largest social media site, with approximately 1.9 billion monthly active users. YouTube is where you want to be to access this large audience and promote your brand, with one billion hours of video watched every day on the platform.

However, for your target audience to watch your videos, you must ensure excellent video quality. Poorly shot or edited films may alienate your viewers, especially when there are billions of other videos to choose from on the site.

* 4k is the most satisfactory resolution for uploading to YouTube. Although not every viewer can watch videos in 4k, it ensures that your visitors get the best possible experience.
* Traditional Full HD (1920 x 1080) TVs feature four times as many pixels as 4K TVs. Because of the higher pixel density, the picture quality of 4K TVs is more colorful and detailed, even on TV displays of the same size. This distinction is most noticeable on large-screen televisions.
* Even if you recorded in 1080p and upscaled to 4K, you should post in 4K to YouTube for the finest image quality. Recording in 1080p, editing in 1080p, exporting in 4k, and YouTube viewing is sharper in 1080p.
* With 4K, you get stunning visuals with a resolution of 38402160, which is four times that of Full-HD. That's why visuals appear crisp and lifelike, even on large-screen TVs rather than pixelated. Down-converted 4K to Full-HD photographs have superior quality and resolution than images shot in Full-HD from the start.
