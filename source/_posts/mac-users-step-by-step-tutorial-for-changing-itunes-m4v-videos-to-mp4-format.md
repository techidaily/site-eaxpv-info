You purchase some Disney movies on iTunes Store and wanna **play iTunes M4V movies on Android tablet** like Google Nexus 9, Sony Xperia Z4 tablet, Samsung Galaxy Tab, etc. But your Android tablets can't play iTunes purchased M4V movies. You add your favorite iTunes TV show to Plex so as to playback on smart TV. Yet, your attempt is all in vain. Your smart TV gives an error message and your Apple devices just fail without any sign. And in other cases, you mean to play iTunes M4V movies with VLC player. Unfortunately, you find your third party player can't support iTunes M4V movies playback. 

Why iTunes M4V files can't play on Android tablet or VLC 3rd party player? That's mainly because your purchased iTunes M4V files are encrypted by DRM technology called FairPlay, which is designed to protect iTunes DRM M4V files being copied to other non-Apple products (This is also one of the reasons why [iTunes won't play music](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)). In other words, if you insist on playing iTunes purchased M4V movies outside of Apple ecosystem, you're required to circumvent the FairPlay encryption from M4V video and then your iTunes movies or TV shows can be renamed from M4V to MP4 file extension. 

To sidestep iTunes DRM from M4V, you need an DRM removal tool. Here **MacX MediaTrans** is the best solution to solve iTunes M4V DRM problem.
