 It is likely that a majority of people can't understand what you want to describe if you speak your native language in your YouTube video. But, if there is subtitle translation, things will get better. Thus, getting your YouTube video embedded with subtitles seems to be pretty necessary. Next, we introduce you two easy ways to put subtitles on a video which you try to upload to YouTube.

Prior to the detailed guide, you'd better download external subs or create new proper subtitles (.srt, .ssa, .aas, .txt, etc) for your YouTube videos. It is more favorable that you can find out needed your native language subtitles (English/Hindi/French/German/Italian) from the popular sites like [Moviesubtitles.org](http://www.moviesubtitles.org/), subscene.com, subtitles.hr and more.

## Way 1: Add Subtitles to a Video on YouTube Itself

Experienced YouTubers will think it is very simple because there is a subtitle setting button on YouTube. Perhaps many of you haven't noticed that. Now, you can follow our steps to add subtitles and closed captions to the video with YouTube itself.

1\. Log into your YouTube account and click "Upload" on the YouTube site (upper right corner of any YouTube page). Then upload your MP4/MKV/3GP/AVI video to YouTube.

2\. Select "Video Manager" which will bring you to your personal page of uploaded videos.

4\. Click the right of the Edit button and then select "Subtitles and CC" from the drop-down menu.

 5\. Hit "Upload a file" and click "Browse" to choose your downloaded subtitle file ([.srt](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), .ssa, .txt, etc). If you are uploading a transcript (with no time syncing), select Transcript, otherwise, select Subtitle file. 

6\. Choose the appropriate language. You may also enter a track name here. Last, click "Upload file".

Sometimes you also will feel depressed in the process of embedding foreign language subtitles to your YouTube videos, like this guy.

_"I uploaded a video on YouTube and went to 'Video Manager' and correctly followed all the instructions. Later, I only can see the notice that subtitles is publishing so that I click to update. But at last, I can't see the subtitles I added when I open the video. I've been trying this for two days now and I still don't know what went wrong? Is there any alternative way to solve the problem?"_
