You got some .wmv files on PC and you'd like to play them on macOS High Sierra MacBook or iPhone iPad running iOS 11, you are recommended to convert these .wmv files to HEVC format. Compatibility is the main reason why we choose to convert WMV to HEVC (also H.265). 

WMV developed by Microsoft in 1999 is commonly used with ASF container format and supported by most Microsoft devices, Android phones and tablets. Other devices such as Apple products iPhone iPad Apple TV Mac computers don't accept WMV files. While HEVC that tends to replace H.264 becomes widely supported after the arrival of iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra that add support for the HEVC codec.

## How to Convert WMV to HEVC on Mac/Windows

**Step 1:** Add source WMV video. Launch the WMV to HEVC converter software on your computer (the latest macOS High Sierra also supported). Click the Videos icon at the top and a window will pop up, allowing you to select source WMV videos. You can add more than one WMV video at a time as the program supports batch WMV to HEVC conversion. Here's an easier way to load source video, just drag and drop the file to the interface.

**Step 2:** Select HEVC as output format. Once the source video is loaded, you'll see the Output Profile Window. Select Mac General Video on the left side of the window, and find MP4 Video (HEVC) and select it. It is MP4 video container format with HEVC/H.265 video codec and AAC codec. The MP4 container format is recommended because of its good compatibility.
