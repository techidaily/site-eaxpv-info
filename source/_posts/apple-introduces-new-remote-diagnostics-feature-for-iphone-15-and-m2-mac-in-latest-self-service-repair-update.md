Jason Hiner/ZDNET

**What you need:** An iPhone running iOS 16.5 or later. Since not all iPhones are compatible with iOS 18, you'll also need a model [newer than the iPhone X](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/).

Go to your iPhone's Settings and select General. 

## 2\. Go to Software Update in Settings

Within General, tap on Software Update. This will show you if the iOS 18 update is available for you to download.

## 3\. Download and install

When you tap on Software Update, your iPhone will check for the latest version of iOS available. Then, you'll be able to Download and Install the new update. Your iPhone will begin the download immediately.

## 4\. Enter your passcode and follow steps to install

Enter your passcode, if necessary, to authorize the installation of the new iOS on your iPhone, and follow the prompts to complete the installation.

After installing the latest iOS update, your iPhone will restart.

### Can you still download the iOS 18 public beta?

You can always be part of the Apple Beta program to get the latest beta versions of iOS. Before you download a beta version of an operating system, you should have some housekeeping items in mind:

* Back up your device and personal information.
* Don't download beta software, which will likely have bugs and glitches, on your everyday iPhone.
* You should go into the experience to test new features and share feedback to improve iOS, which is why beta versions are released.

### How do I install the iOS 18 beta version?

You'll need an iPhone running iOS 16.5 or later. Since not all iPhones are compatible with iOS 18, you'll also need a model [newer than the iPhone X](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/).

1. Go to your iPhone's Settings and select General.
2. Go to Software Update in Settings.
3. Enable Beta Updates. To enable Beta Updates, go to Beta Updates and select the iOS version you'd like to access. This setting is turned off by default on iPhones.
4. Select iOS 18 Public Beta. Then you'll begin receiving automatic software updates to the latest beta version of iOS 18\. Apple currently has four beta versions of iOS: iOS 18 public beta, iOS 18 developer beta, iOS 17 public beta, and iOS 17 developer beta. These four options will soon be reduced to just the two iOS 18 variants. Once you do this, return to the previous page. If an update is available now, your iPhone will prompt you to download and install it.
