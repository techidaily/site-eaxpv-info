 The premium features you get with Snapchat+ are so compelling that you'll find it hard to go back once you subscribe. I subscribed to Snapchat+ a few months ago and can't imagine unsubscribing now. Today, I'll explain the features that keep me hooked and how they can be a game changer for you.

##  I Can Keep My Stories Up for More Than 24 Hours

![Selecting the time when a snap disappears from status on Snapchat.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2-selecting-the-time-when-a-snap-disappears-from-status-on-snapchat.jpg) 

 When you're on a free plan, [any story you add](https://techidaily.com/update-your-drivers-with-device-manager-on-windows-10-by-drivereasy-guide/) expires exactly after one day (24 hours). While that's a reasonable time frame and common among most social media apps, Snapchat's premium Story Expiration feature gives you more control over how long your story stays up.

 Have an important announcement you want all your friends to see? You can keep the story up from more than one day to a week. Planning a short stay and want friends to meet up? You can add a story that lasts only one hour or a few hours.

 In short, you can keep your story up as long as needed. That's what I liked the most after subscribing to Snapchat+.

##  Snapchat Reminds Me About Streaks Before They Expire

 If you've ever lost a [Snapstreak](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/mastering-corporate-communication-with-gpt/) that had been going on for years, you know how bad that feels. I've experienced it a couple of times. While it’s possible to appeal to Snapchat and sometimes get your streak back, Snapchat doesn't always respond to your appeal and restore it. They might do it once, but not if you request it again.

 To avoid all this hassle, I'm grateful to Snapchat for adding the Snapstreak Reminders feature, which notifies me an hour before a Snapstreak is about to expire. Once I get the reminder, I can send the snap and keep the streak going. If I miss checking in on time, Snapchat+ offers one free in-app Snapstreak restore each month, which I can use to recover the lost streak.

##  I Can Watch Snaps Multiple Times

![The option to replay a snap on Snapchat.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4-the-option-to-replay-a-snap-on-snapchat.jpg) 

 Have you ever wanted to rewatch a snap multiple times or show it to someone else but can only replay it once? If so, you’ll appreciate this feature offered by Snapchat Premium. Known as Reply Again, it gives you an extra replay of your snaps before they disappear. Usually, you can replay a snap once, but with Premium, you can replay it twice.

 Although it's just one extra replay, it makes a massive difference for me. First, I don’t have to save the snap to rewatch it again, which avoids letting the sender know I’ve saved it. Secondly, for friends who are okay with me saving their snaps, I can save them during the second replay if I missed it the first time.

##  I Can Easily Keep Track of My Close Friends

 Snapchat has a Solar System feature that lets you see if you’re among the eight people your friends interact with the most. If you are, you’ll be assigned a planet in your friend’s solar system based on your rank. If you’re the top person they interact with, you get Mercury. If you’re in the eighth spot, you’ll be assigned Neptune, the last planet in the solar system.

 While I wouldn’t say I can’t live without this feature, it’s handy for tracking where I stand in my friends’ solar system. Remember that this ranking is based on your interactions with that person, not how close you are in real life. It also changes over time so that you might be Mercury one month and in a different position the next. So, don’t stress too much about it.

##  I Can Identify Which Friend Interacted Just by the Notification Tone

![Selecting a custom notification sound for a friend on Snapchat.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/3-selecting-a-custom-notification-sound-for-a-friend-on-snapchat.jpg)

 I’m a big fan of custom notifications and use them for almost every app that offers it. While some apps, like WhatsApp, let you use this feature for free, Snapchat hides it behind a paywall. Only premium subscribers can take advantage of this fantastic feature. Since subscribing to Snapchat+, I’ve been using it regularly.

 This feature allows me to assign custom notification sounds for friends and [group chats I’m part of](https://some-tips.techidaily.com/unlocking-vlcs-full-potential-for-transforming-mp4-and-various-formats-for-2024/). That way, when someone sends me a text or snap, I can identify who it is just by the notification sound without checking my phone. This is another reason I’m so hooked on Snapchat Premium and can’t imagine unsubscribing.

##  I’m in Love With Premium Bitmoji Backgrounds

![Selecting a premium background on Snapchat.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/5-selecting-a-premium-background-on-snapchat.jpg) 

 Snapchat has cleverly locked some stylish Bitmoji backgrounds behind the premium subscription. You can preview them to see how your Bitmoji looks with these backgrounds, but you can only use them if you’re subscribed to Snapchat+. That was one of the things I always wanted to try when I was a free user.

 So, soon after subscribing, one of the first things I did was to use my favorite background. If you also care about how your Bitmoji looks, these elegant backgrounds will definitely impress you.

##  Premium and AI-Generated Wallpapers Are Amazing

 You probably know how great they can look if you use chat wallpapers. Unfortunately, some stylish wallpapers are only available to premium subscribers. Like Bitmoji backgrounds, I’ve been using these premium chat wallpapers since I subscribed, and I often switch between them to add a touch of flair to my conversations.

 What’s even cool is that Snapchat lets you create custom wallpapers based on any prompts you come up with. You can enter a prompt in the wallpaper selection area, and Snapchat will generate a wallpaper for you. However, remember that these wallpapers might not be as impressive as those created with [specialized image-generation tools](https://win11.techidaily.com/navigate-to-public-ip-using-windows-command-window/).

##  Snapchat+ Badge Distinguishes My Profile

 When you subscribe to Snapchat Premium, a black star badge is added to your profile to show you’re a premium subscriber. This sets your profile apart from your friends using the free version of Snapchat. Friends who recognize the badge will know you’re using premium features so that you can show it off.

 Also, when you use these premium features, your friends will likely ask, "Where did you get these amazing backgrounds, wallpapers, badges, and more?"

##  Story Timestamps and Rewatch Indicator

![Checking the timestamp of when a friend viewed my status on Snapchat.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/1-checking-the-timestamp-of-when-a-friend-viewed-my-status-on-snapchat.jpg)

 Apps like WhatsApp show you when a specific friend viewed your story (or status) by displaying a timestamp. This flexibility isn’t available on Snapchat’s free plan. You need to have Snapchat's premium subscription to track the timestamps of your story views. This feature is useful because it helps me determine the best time to post a story.

 Additionally, Snapchat offers the Rewatch Indicator feature, which shows how many friends rewatch your stories. By observing which stories are rewatched frequently and by how many friends, you can effectively tailor your story content to match the preferences of your audience better.

 A Snapchat+ subscription unlocks many valuable features not available on the free plan. I’ve highlighted the features I like most, why I enjoy them, and how they can improve your experience. If you haven’t tried Snapchat+ before, I recommend taking advantage of the free trial to try these features out. You might end up as hooked as I am now.
