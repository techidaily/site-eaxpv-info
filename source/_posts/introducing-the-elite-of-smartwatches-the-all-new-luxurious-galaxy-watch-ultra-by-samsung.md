## Introducing the Elite of Smartwatches: The All-New, Luxurious Galaxy Watch Ultra by Samsung

The [Apple Watch Ultra](https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-bandicam-in-depth-review-for-the-modern-user/) was one of the most surprising announcements by Apple in recent memory. It's a smartwatch meant to survive rougher physical conditions and sea depths, with a bunch of extra "pro" features to go with it. Now, Samsung is coming out with its own alternative: meet the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra.

 Samsung has just announced the Galaxy Watch Ultra, a new addition to its Galaxy Watch portfolio and probably the [most premium Wear OS smartwatch](https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/can-i-use-itools-gpx-file-to-catch-the-rare-pokemon-on-poco-f5-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) money can buy. The Watch Ultra builds on the health monitoring and hardware capabilities of the Galaxy Watch7, but according to Samsung, it takes things even further with a few extra reinforcements and features.

 It features a new cushion design and a Dynamic Lug System for comfort, as well as a Titanium Grade 4 frame and 10ATM water resistance, making it durable enough to withstand extreme environments. Its ability to operate at altitudes ranging from 500 meters below sea level to 9,000 meters high makes it suitable for activities from ocean swimming to high-altitude cycling.

 The Watch Ultra introduces a Multisports tile for tracking multi-course workouts like triathlons. It also offers Functional Threshold Power (FTP) for cycling, which measures maximum cycling power in just 4 minutes with AI-powered metrics. Additionally, it provides a Personalized HR Zone feature for running at optimal intensity levels.

 With a Quick Button, you can instantly initiate and control workouts or map other functions to the button. An Emergency Siren is also included for safety. Dedicated watch faces automatically switch to Night Mode for optimal readability in the dark, and a peak brightness of 3,000 nits ensures readability even in bright sunlight. The Watch Ultra offers the longest battery life within the Galaxy Watch line-up, providing up to 100 hours in Power Saving and 48 hours in Exercise Power Saving.
