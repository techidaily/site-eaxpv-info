## Part 1: How to See Your YouTube Subscribers List?

Finding out who your subscribers are on YouTube is a simple process that takes a minimum amount of time and effort.

1\. In order to do so, you first need to go to your channel's home page and then click on the Creator Studio icon located in the upper right corner of the screen next to your profile picture.

![YouTube Subscriber Creator Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/see-youtube-subscriber-create-studio.jpg)

You can also access the Creator Studio by clicking on your icon in the top right corner of any screen on YouTube and selecting it from the drop-down menu.

2\. Once the Creator Studio opens, you'll be able to see different menus such as Analytics and Video Manager.

3\. You'll need to click on the Community menu, which provides insight into messages or comments among other things.

4\. Select the Subscribers option from the menu and wait for the list of the subscribers to appear on your screen. You'll be able to see a list of YouTube users that have subscribed to your channel.

![Finding YouTube Subscribers ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-youtube-subscriber-in-community.jpg)

Constantly checking the list of subscribers is a great way to keep track of new subscribers to your channel, which is important if you want to know how many new subscribers you got within a day or a week.

If you would like to go through a more detailed tutorial about how to see who your subscribers are, click [here and learn each step of this simple process.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKndwFejMow)

If you’re using YouTube Studio, you can go to the **Recent subscribers** card on the Dashboard, and then click **SEE ALL** to check the list of the recent subscribers.

## Part 2: How to See Which of Your Subscribers are the Most Popular

The list of subscribers to your channel offered by YouTube's Creator Studio can be used for a variety of different purposes. You can compare your channel to channels with a similar number of subscribers, or you can find out how many users that have subscribed to your channel have around the same (or even more) subscribers than you do. If you are thinking about [creating a collab video](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-collab-videos-and-grow-your-channel-206.html), your list of subscribers can be a great source of potential partners.

So in order to see which of your subscribers are the most popular, you simply need to change the settings in the Subscribers panel from most recent to most popular.

## Part 3: How to See Other People’s Subscribers

Seeing the list of subscribers on other people's channels is no longer possible on YouTube, even though it was a common feature in the past.

What you can do is select one of your subscribers from the subscriber list on your channel, and go to their channel and then click on the About option that will show you the number of subscribers and the total number of views to the channel (or [use one of these tools to see the sub count of any channel in real-time](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)).

Unfortunately, YouTube channel owners can no longer browse through other people's subscribers and for that reason, their interactions with potential subscribers are somewhat limited.

If you want to get more subscribers, you must consider your channel's branding. Want to improve your branding? [Click here to see examples from popular channels that have nailed their brand.](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-brand-your-youtube-channel-to-get-more-subscribers-411.html)

## Zeroing in on Audio Quality: Achievable Sans Mic

# How to Record Good Audio Without a Microphone?

Audio quality is more important than video quality on YouTube. You’ve probably heard that before – viewers might forgive sub-par video quality if they're interested in what you're saying, but if it’s hard to understand what you’re saying they'll click away.

Getting an external mic (even a **[$10 one-off Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Microphone-Seacue-Omnidirectional-Condenser-Smartphones/dp/B0727Z8TMX/ref=sr%5F1%5F5?ie=UTF8&qid=1504204000&sr=8-5&keywords=lav+mic)**) is one of the best ways to improve your videos. That said, maybe your budget is $0\. Or, maybe you just don’t happen to have a mic now and don’t want to wait to make videos. It could even be that you just don’t want to bother with an external mic.

Luckily, there are a lot of easy, free, things you can do to protect the quality of your audio recording even if you’re not using an external mic. Here are a few tips:

* [1\. Keep Your Camera Close](#close)
* [2\. Shoot Somewhere Quiet](#quiet)
* [3\. Pick a Good Room](#room)
* [4\. Protect your Built-In Mic from Wind](#wind)
* [5\. Use a Free Audio App](#app)
* [6\. Do a Sound Check](#check)

## 1\. Keep Your Camera Close (like, really close)

The biggest problem with the mic built into any camera or phone is just that, since it’s with the camera, it’s usually too far away from you. Built-in mics can record decent audio up close, but usually, your camera will be set up farther away from you than an external mic would be.

For example, your camera’s mic might be just as good as a clip-on LAV, but that LAV is right by your mouth and the camera is a couple of big steps away.

Moving your camera/smartphone physically closer to you will make it hard to include anything besides your head and shoulders in your shot, but it will get you significantly better audio.

## 2.Shoot Somewhere Quiet

The best way to limit the amount of background noise you pick up in your sound recording is to shoot somewhere where there’s no background noise. That probably seems really basic, but it’s something a lot of people just don’t do. It’s easy to default to recording in your home office, even though it’s right next to the kitchen where your family is bustling around, or in your bedroom even though there’s a busy street right outside your window.

Sometimes the best thing you can do for your audio is simply to scout out a quiet room in your house where the sound recording conditions are better. Speaking of recording conditions…

## 3\. Pick a Good Room

There’s more that goes into picking a good room than how quiet it is. If you try to record in a room that’s too big your voice might sound to distant, and if you try to record in a room that’s too small your audio will be too echo-y. You need a room that’s just right.

You should also pay attention to what’s in the room you’re recording in. Avoid hard, reflective, surfaces like appliances and mirrors which your voice will bounce off of. The same conditions that make you sound great when you sing in the shower will – like recording in a small space -make your voiceover unpleasantly echo-y.

Look for a room that has a lot of soft things in it, like beds and sofas.

## 4\. Protect your Built-In Mic from Wind

If you shoot outside, then the wind passing over your built-in mic will do terrible things to your audio. You can do a lot to counter-act this problem by physically blocking the wind.

There are a few ways to do this. If you’re doing hand-held shots you can partially cover your camera or phone’s mic with your finger. You don’t want to completely cover it/press down or your audio will be muffled. What you’re trying to do is create a barrier blocking out the wind.

On movie sets, they block out wind by covering the microphones with big fuzzy things called ‘dead cats’. You can also block out wind noise by attaching something fuzzy to your microphone. If your camera’s built-in mic is on front of it then you just need something big and fluffy you can loop around the lens. You can use a piece of a boa, a fuzzy novelty scrunchie – you can even murder a fuzzy stuffed animal! Do you have an old coat with a fuzz around the hood? That fuzz would do nicely.

_The pompom used in this video cost $2, but you might already have something that would work!_

If your built-in mic is on top of your camera you can get something called a ‘micromuff’. A micromuff is essentially a circular or rectangular piece of velcro with long strands of fluff on top. It’s open in the middle so it doesn’t actually cover your mic, but the surrounding fuzz blocks out the wind.

![Record better audio from wind with micromuff](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-better-audio-from-wind.jpg)

_You use the adhesive backing to attach the base velcro to your camera. The other side of the velcro has your fluff attached to the back._

The only thing about a micromuff is that it costs about $30, and if you’re going to spend $30 on audio equipment then you could just buy yourself an inexpensive LAV mic. I only bring up the micromuff because it’s a very simple design you can probably DIY – you just need velcro with adhesive backing and any of the fluff-sources we just discussed.

## 5\. Use a Free Audio App

If you’re recording on a smartphone, you can download a free app that will let you make adjustments to your audio as you record it. With the right app, you can adjust your gain (volume is how you control ‘output’ audio, and gain is for ‘input’ audio. By turning up your gain, you can make your mic more sensitive), tempo, and more. A lot of the time, your audio recording app will also let you edit your audio afterward.

Even if you’re not recording video from your smartphone, it might be a good idea to use your phone as your mic and record a separate audio file. You’ll be able to use an app to fine-tune your recording, and you can set your phone up closer to you the way you would an external mic while keeping your camera back a bit farther.

Free audio apps: Hi-Q MP3 Voice Recorder (Android), RecForge II (Android), Smart Voice Recorder (Android), Audio Memos (iOS), and Recorder Plus (iOS).

## 6\. Do a Sound Check

Once you think you’ve got good audio set up – test it! You don’t want to do a whole video and find out when you play it back that your audio doesn’t sound good.
