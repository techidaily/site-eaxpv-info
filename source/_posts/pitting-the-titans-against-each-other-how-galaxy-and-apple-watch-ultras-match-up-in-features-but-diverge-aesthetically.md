## Pitting the Titans Against Each Other: How Galaxy and Apple Watch Ultras Match Up in Features but Diverge Aesthetically

### Key Takeaways

* The Galaxy Watch Ultra costs $649.99, while the Apple Watch Ultra 2 costs $799\. Both smartwatches offer GPS and cellular connectivity.
* Compared to the Watch Ultra 2, the Galaxy Watch Ultra offers a few additional health-tracking features, such as sleep apnea detection and Energy Score.
* The Apple Watch Ultra 2 offers accurate heart rate and activity tracking, but the blood oxygen sensor hasn't been functional since January 2024.

 Now that the Galaxy Watch Ultra is here, there will be an obvious comparison with the original "Ultra" smartwatch: the Apple Watch Ultra 2\. While both devices stand their ground as top-tier smartwatches by the respective companies, there are a few key differences that can help potential buyers make an informed decision.

##  Price & Availability

 The all-new [Galaxy Watch Ultra](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartwatch-Wellness-Tracking-Manufacturer/dp/B0D7F1LS4Q?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004318&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgalaxy-watch-ultra-vs-apple-watch-ultra-2%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) (Wi-Fi + 4G LTE) costs $649.99\. It is available in three colors: Titanium Gray, Titanium White, and Titanium Silver. You can also choose from three strap types: Marine, Trail, and PeakForm. It will be available for pre-orders through July 24, after which it should be available through all leading online and offline stores.

 The [Apple Watch Ultra 2](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cellular-Smartwatch-Precision-Extra-Long/dp/B0CSVMM8LR?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004318&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgalaxy-watch-ultra-vs-apple-watch-ultra-2%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) (GPS + Cellular) is listed on the company's website for $799\. It is available with three different bands — Alpine, Trail, and Ocean — each with its own colorways. With some digging, you can find the wearable on sale for between $700 and $750\. You can get the device through an Apple Store and all the leading online/offline stores.

##  The Apple Watch Offers a Larger Screen

 The [Galaxy Watch Ultra ships with a 1.5-inch Super AMOLED screen](https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-complete-guide-to-reversing-tiktok-videos-tips-and-tricks/). While the device looks like it has a square screen, it has a circular screen packed within a square frame with rounded edges. The device also features sapphire crystal glass, can shine as bright as 3,000 nits, and provides a resolution of 327 pixels per inch. There's also a Night Mode for optimal readability in the dark.

 On the other hand, the [Watch Ultra 2 features a larger 1.92-inch Retina LTPO OLED](https://driver-download.techidaily.com/latest-amd-rx-6800-driver-download-for-windows-users-windows-111087/) rectangular display (with rounded edges). Like the Galaxy Watch Ultra, the Watch Ultra 2's screen can achieve a peak brightness of 3,000 nits and has a resolution of 326 pixels per inch, along with a layer of sapphire crystal. For a comfortable viewing experience in the dark, the screen can go as low as a nit. You can also enable the Night Mode via the Modular Ultra or Wayfinder watch faces.

##  Durability and Water-Resistance, Explained

![Person holding the Galaxy Watch Ultra](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/person-holding-the-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra_53845587877_o.jpg) 

Justin Duino / How-To Geek

 Back in 2022, Apple launched the first 'Ultra' smartwatch, linking the moniker with bulky, rugged wearables that sport better water resistance and durability than the regular models, and that's exactly what the Galaxy Watch Ultra and the Watch Ultra 2 offer.

 To start things off, the Galaxy Watch Ultra (60.5 grams) features a 47.4mm Titanium frame, which improves its overall durability. The device carries a 10ATM water resistance and an [IP68 dust resistance rating](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-artificer-intelligence-redefines-what-we-perceive-as-real-or-just-a-story/). It also comes with the MIL-STD-810H certification, instilling confidence in using the device during harsh conditions. Samsung says the device can withstand temperatures up to 55°C and operates at a wider range of altitudes (500 meters below sea level to 9,000 meters high).

 However, the brand's statement about whether the device is built for high-velocity water sports or recreational diving seems to be somewhat inconsistent. For instance, the product page mentions that the watch can track swimming, water skiing, kayaking, or windsurfing. But the fine print on the same page suggests that the [Watch Ultra is water resistance for 10 minutes](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-mastering-sports-viewership-in-the-digital-age/) in water with a depth of 100 meters. The Galaxy Watch Ultra can survive "submersion in up to 1.5 meters fresh water for up to 30 minutes," but "it is not suitable for high-pressure water activities and diving."

 While the [Watch Ultra 2 (61.4 grams) features 100m water resistance](https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-superior-mac-screen-recorder-options-not-bandicam/) and IP6X dust resistance, it can also be used for recreational diving (up to 40 meters) and high-speed water sports. In fact, the smartwatch is also fit for scuba diving under the EN13319 standard. The 49mm Titanium chassis, MIL-STD-810H certification, and the operational range (for temperature and altitude) are similar to Galaxy Watch Ultra.

##  Both Watches Are Loaded With Health-Monitoring Features

Tyler Hayes / How-To Geek

 Powered by the [new W1000 (3nm) chipset](https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-pause-life360-location-sharing-for-oppo-reno-9a-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), the Galaxy Watch Ultra features a plethora of sensors, including an electrical heart sensor, a geomagnetic sensor, an infrared temperature sensor, and an optical heart rate sensor. With these, [the device can conduct an ECG](https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/new-cutting-edge-ipad-video-editing-the-top-5-tools/), measure heart rate, skin temperature, and blood oxygen saturation. What sets the Galaxy Watch Ultra apart is Samsung's BioActive Sensor, which can estimate the user's body mass index and blood pressure.

 Samsung also got the FDA's approval for detecting early signs of sleep apnea, something that the Apple Watch Ultra 2 can't do. Combining information from several sensors, the device can also record the advanced glycation end products (AGEs) index, which refers to users' metabolism. There are two AI-infused features as well, including the new Energy Score, which is similar to the [Daily Readiness Score on the Fitbit Charge 6](https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/how-to-update-your-steelseries-drivers-on-windows-devices/). The device calculates this score by evaluating users' sleep, activity, sleeping heart rate, and sleeping heart rate variability. Based on the score (between 0 and 100), the watch provides users with Wellness Tips to improve upon certain aspects.

 Based on Apple's S9 chip (with a four-core Neural Engine), the Watch Ultra 2 features many sensors, including electric and optical heart sensors, a temperature sensor, a depth gauge, and a water temperature sensor, among others. It is important to mention that the ability to measure blood oxygen is [no longer available on Apple Watch Ultra 2 units](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-fix-obs-camera-not-working/) sold in the United States. Besides, the smartwatch can also track users' sleep, take ECG readings, and recognize early signs of atrial fibrillation.

 Some common features on both devices include fall detection, menstrual cycle tracking, [low or high heart rate alerts](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/spoofing-life360-how-to-do-it-on-honor-magic-5-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), a programmable action button, gesture controls, and an emergency siren (85dB on the Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. 86dB on the Apple Watch Ultra). However, when compared neck to neck, it looks like the Galaxy Watch Ultra packs a few more health-focused features. That is not to say that the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is a slouch. In fact, the smartwatch's heart rate sensors are one of the most accurate on any consumer-grade wearable device.

##  The Galaxy Watch Ultra Has a Larger Battery

![Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra sitting on a table next to the Apple Watch Ultra](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-sitting-on-a-table-next-to-the-apple-watch-ultra.jpg) 

Justin Duino / How-To Geek

 The Galaxy Watch Ultra ships with a 590mAh battery, which, on paper, is bigger than the 542mAh cell on the Apple Watch Ultra 2\. The difference in battery capacity is also evident through the rated battery life, which is up to 60 hours (with always-on display) for the former and up to 36 hours for the latter. Samsung also says that the watch can last up to 80 hours with always-on display disabled. Further, the [power saving mode](https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/mastering-airpod-connectivity-on-laptops-updated-fixes-for-windows-1011/) extends the Galaxy Watch Ultra's battery life up to 100 hours, while the Watch Ultra 2 can go up to 72 hours.

 Hence, if you're on team Samsung, you'll reach out for the charger quite less than you'd if you're on team Apple. Speaking of the charger, both devices can go from zero to 100% battery in about two hours with the magnetic charging dock in the box.

##  Wear OS 5 vs. watchOS 10: Which Is Your Favorite?

![Watches running watchOS 10](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/watchos-10.jpg) 

Apple

 Out of the box, Samsung's Ultra watch runs on One UI 6 atop [Google's Wear OS 5](https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/quick-guide-getting-the-latest-thrustmaster-t150-driver-software-downloaded/). On the other hand, the Watch Ultra 2 features [watchOS 10](https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ghostly-3-melee-golem-4s-challenge/). Both operating systems have some key standout features. For instance, Wear OS provides a detailed sleep analysis, whereas watchOS features the popular workout rings. With Wear OS, users get Google Wallet and Google Assistant, whereas watchOS offers Apple Pay and Siri. Naturally, users in the respective ecosystems would be more inclined to get the latest smartwatch from the company, which also makes perfect sense.

##  Which Is Right for You?

 The answer is simple. If you own a [Samsung Galaxy smartphone](https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/nlocking-the-secrets-to-earnings-on-youtube-shorts-for-2024/), the Galaxy Watch Ultra is the way to go. Even though it doesn't offer a larger screen and isn't suitable for water sports, it provides seamless connectivity with Galaxy devices. Similarly, if you [own an iPhone](https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-drone-buddies-kids-most-enjoyed-toy-companions/), Apple Watch Ultra 2 is an obvious choice.

 But what if someone owns both a Galaxy smartphone and an iPhone? In that case, one must prioritize the features they want. For those who want better battery life and detailed health insights, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is an excellent (and more affordable) option. However, for professionals or hobbyists who like to go swimming in deep waters, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 would be a wise choice.
