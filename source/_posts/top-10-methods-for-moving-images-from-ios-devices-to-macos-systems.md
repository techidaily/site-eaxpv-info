When iCloud Photos is activated, you have no need to manually transfer photos between iPhone and MacBook iMac. iCloud always uploads and stores your original, full-resolution photos in HEIF, JPEG, RAW, PNG, GIF, TIFF formats.

iCloud service is so convenient and simple to use, and why we recommend it in the minor place? Generally because iCloud free storage is so limited, only 5GB. Thus, you have to pay more to get expansive space, 50GB, 200GB and 2TB premium options. Beyond that, iCloud errors like photos not uploading to iCloud, iCloud backup couldn't be completed occur now and then. And you also need to guarantee a high-speed network connection for photos (esp. 4K) downloading in bulk.

## Part 9\. Transfer iPhone Photos to Mac using WhatsApp

WhatsApp is not primarily designed for transferring photos from your iPhone to your Mac, but you can use it as a temporary medium for sending iPhone photos to yourself, and then download those photos on your Mac. Here's how you can do it:

Step 1\. Open WhatsApp on your iPhone. Make sure you have WhatsApp installed and set up on your iPhone. 

Step 2\. Send Photos to yourself. 

* Open the chat with yourself (you can create a chat by sending a message to your own number).
* Tap the camera icon in the chat box to access your iPhone's camera or photo gallery.
* Select the photos you want to transfer and send them to your own WhatsApp chat.

![sync photos from iPhone to MacBook with Whatsapp](https://www.macxdvd.com/mobile/article-image/whatsapp.jpg) 

Step 3\. Download photos on your MacBook Pro/Air or iMac.

* On your Mac, open a web browser and go to web.whatsapp.com.
* You'll see a QR code on the webpage. On your iPhone, tap the three dots (Menu) in the top right corner of the WhatsApp app and select "WhatsApp Web."
* Scan the QR code displayed on the web page using your iPhone's camera.
* Once the QR code is scanned, your WhatsApp chats will be accessible on your Mac.
