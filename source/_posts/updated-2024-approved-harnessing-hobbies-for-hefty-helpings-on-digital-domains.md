You can get paid to review products on YouTube, and that's just one of the benefits. Here are a few more:

* You get to help your viewers by providing them with both factual information, and the opinion of someone they trust (you!).
* Your reviews can help people save money! By watching your videos, viewers will be able to make informed buying decisions.
* Your reviews can help YOU save money! Once you build up a following of loyal subscribers, brands will start sending you free products to review.

## How to Make Money on YouTube Doing Product Reviews

First, you need to find a product that you want to review. The product should be related to a topic you know a lot about. This will make your review more credible. It is easier to grow your channel if you focus on a niche (i.e. camera equipment or makeup) you are particularly knowledgeable about.

* [Getting Products for Free](#freeproducts)

### Part 1: Get Paid by Reviewing Product with Affiliate Links

One of the main ways you can make money doing reviews is through affiliate links. When you join the affiliate program of an online store they will allow you to create special links, called affiliate links, to products listed there. You post these affiliate links in the descriptions of your video reviews and, if viewers choose to click on those links and buy the products, you will earn a sales commission. Here are some stores with great affiliate programs:

#### 1\. JVZoo

You can find high end products for about $5 to $10\. Budgeting will be important if you plan on purchasing products to review instead of only reviewing products you already own (you should try to review items you already have as much as possible).

#### 2\. Click Bank

You can find a wide range of interesting products here, and you can earn as much as 75% on sales commissions if you provide your viewers with an affiliate link.

#### 3\. Warrior Plus

This is a highly renowned affiliate program. It very similar to JVZoo.

#### 4\. Amazon

It doesn’t get any better than Amazon. You can find just about anything.

### Part 2:  Getting Products for Free

Once you’ve built up authority as a reviewer, brands will start giving you free stuff to review. Until then, you can buy the products yourself or review products which you already own. It will be a lot cheaper to review things you already have, or which you were already planning to buy, than to buy products for the purpose of reviewing them. Your reviews will also be more detailed and useful when they are on products you are especially familiar with.

Once you start building a following, brands will come to you and it will be your choice whether you want to review the things they send you. Until then, try to promote/review products you already have opinions on.

### Part 3:  Filming the Video

Be completely honest. People are going to know when you are trying to sell something. Fake reviewers are all over the place, and they are easily spotted.

That does not mean you shouldn’t make money through affiliate links, or accept free products to review. So long as you are honest in your opinions, and open with your viewers about any relationships you have with brands, you are not ‘selling out’.

**Bottom Line**

It takes time to earn any money reviewing products on YouTube. However, once you are an established authority in your niche, brands might start coming to you on their own.

If you were going to be paid to review products on YouTube, what kinds of products would they be? And if you want to make the reviewing video better, you should use a video editing software like [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) .

## What Is a YouTube Video Background?

A **YouTube video background** is a simple image or video that sits in place at the back of your videos. It’s just a simple background that can greatly impact your brand, presence, and style as a creator.

Even something as small as your **YouTube video thumbnail background** can strongly impact your results.

Obviously, choosing the right **custom YouTube background** is important. And, now that it’s winter, this requires a special approach.

## Why Are Seasonal Backgrounds Effective?

There are several important reasons why a seasonal YouTube video background or photo, and other elements are very effective and engage us more.

The main reasons include:

* Creates a meaningful connection;
* Boosts engagement with fellow winter lovers;
* Builds a better brand;
* Enhances everyone’s mood, especially during the holidays.

So, whenever you can and whenever there is an opportunity, don’t be afraid to use a seasonal **YouTube video background download**.

## Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos

Now, before we dive into the examples themselves and the tutorial on how to make the best backgrounds yourself, here are several factors you must consider before proceeding.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Content Relevance

As a video creator, you must ensure to be consistent with your elements. This includes your **background tune for YouTube videos.** For example, if you’re talking about books in your video, including a bookshelf in the winter background makes all the difference.

### Audience Appeal

If you already have an audience, regardless of its size, you should definitely consider what they like and don’t like. You should then leverage this information to create highly appealing content for them and adjust your background scenery accordingly.

### Lighting and Visibility

Another thing you must ensure is to keep your background simple and not too distracting. Remember, even though you have the **best background for YouTube videos**, you still need to realize that it’s not the main focus of the video. It’s just there to make it better.

### Personal Branding

If you want to improve your brand identity and get your name known by more people, incorporate your logo, name, or something similar in the background. It will have a small but meaningful impact, and it’s easy to do.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Editing

Finally, once you have the perfect YouTube studio background, it’s time to glue it to your video and upload this masterpiece.

In order to do this, you will need to use a video editing platform once again. This is not optional as there is no other way to merge these clips.

Luckily, you now have Filmora downloaded and can easily make it happen.

So, here’s how to combine everything.

##### Step 1

Start up a New Project in Filmora.

##### Step 2

Click on **“**My Media” and then click in the middle of the small box to upload your background and your video clips.

##### Step 3

After uploading all the files, simply drag everything in a separate Track down on the Timeline.

##### Step 4

Export and upload to YouTube. That’s it!

## Summary

You’re now ready to make some outstanding Winter YouTube videos and bless everyone with amazing scenery and backgrounds that will make their hearts warm up. Not only do you have infinite backgrounds to choose from, you also know how to perfectly blend them in any of your videos.

Enjoy!
