Recently I was starting to learn Spanish myself, my favorite way to learn a foreign language is to find book written in simple sentences for reading. With a Kindle, it becomes even graceful, the built-in dictionary saves me lots of time and space.

Amazon doesn't provide me a built-in Spanish-English dictionary, and I only found 2 available Spanish-English dictionaries in Kindle Store, but the ratings are below average. I do not want to waste money on a useless dictionary, so I begin to dig my Kindle resource.

In my Kindle library, I saw a book called _Real Academia Española el Diccionario de la lengua española_, this is a spanish dictionary, isn't it? But what the heck Amazon doesn't allow me to download it. I click the "actions" button but can't see the "Deliver to..." option, and login my Kindle for PC I also can't see it in my "Archived Items" section.

Obviously I have to find a way out myself. After some searches on the internet, I finally got a free and working Spanish to English dictionary for Kindle, it is built by [Dave Slusher](http://www.evilgeniuschronicles.org/), he DIYed this Kindle dictionary himself by RUBY scripts.

But here comes another setback, the dictionary is created in 2010 and for Kindle 2, which only uses one dictionary at a time. Therefore I can't use it because I need dictionaries for other languages also.

Then I find Mac Sturm modified the dictionary to make it working on K4 and later models, and click the button below you can download it. Notice: You can download and use for totally free and legit under Creative Commons license: BY-NC-SA.

And I guess some people may also need the English to Spanish dictionary, I've also find a free one for you.

Further to my initial attempts, I tried a couple of different book converters. One did not work (error converting), but finally I got one that did work! It is called Zamzar, and it worked fairly quickly and sent the mobi file to my email address when finished converting.

 Dictionary now installed in my old 2010 Kindle (mark 1?) and works fine.

 Thanks for this very useful system.

 Thank you for the feedback, I've modified the content, now it won't direct to that lapsed converter.

Hi, I was able to convert the .prc file to .mobi and I have transferred it to my Kindle, but when I open my settings and try to select it as my dictionary, it doesn't appear. It appears on my home though. Help please :(

Calibre didn't work for me. But I did convert it to .epub online using zamzar (zamzar dot com). The dictionary was converted almost instantly and so far has worked fine on my Kindle.

I live in Spain and I am also studying Spanish. I have been looking for one of these since I have started reading Spanish Novels to study. I am downloading now and I will report back tomorrow, if this is as good as it sounds, I'll send you a donation!

Wooooooooah!!! I downloaded both and they work incredibly! Thank for so much! Note: My calibre (which I have used for years) didn't like the Spanish to English PRC file. It spent 8 minutes battling and then gave up. I used zamzam.com like some other user has said and they emailed me the converted mobi for free without any registration.

 Thank you again, would love to buy you a beer, can you donate?

I have the same need for what I have heard referred to as an "imbedded dictionary" for my e-reader. My problem is that instead of a Kindle, I have the Barnes & Noble color reader, the Nook. I've waited patientiently about 5 years now, hoping to find a way to download an imbedded dictionary for it. I need a fairly sophisticated Spanish-to-English dictionary (the Real Academics would be great) since I have retired from teaching college-level Spanish & dread losing vocabulary.   
 Whatever advice you may have would be greatly appreciated.  
 Warmly,  
 Lee

This is a resourceful page. Calibre failed to recognize the first file on Mac OS X El Capitan. Zamzar did the job fine. The dictionaries are splendid especially when considering that I'm getting them for free. Freebies are the best, me thinks.

This Spanish-English dictionary works great even with the "Kindle for Windows 10" app. Had to Google a bit for how to fool the Kindle app into using this file, but got it to work in a few minutes. Thank you!
