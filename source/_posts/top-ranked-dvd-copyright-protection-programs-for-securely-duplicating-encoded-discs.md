## Is the DVD Protection Removed Forever by DVD Copy Protection Program? 

_I have no problems in ripping protected DVD to Macbook, my main confusion is with the term "remove copy right protection". When I do this, is it permanently removed from the DVD by [DVD decoder](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), or is it something that the software to copy protected DVD just does when reading a DVD and it doesn't affect the original DVD whatsoever?_ 

The original [DVD copy protection](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) still remains. All the DVD decrypter freeware or paid software only bypass the DVD protection and make a digital copy of the encrypted DVD.
