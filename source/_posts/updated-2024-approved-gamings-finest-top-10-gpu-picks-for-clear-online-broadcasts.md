Continue with further editing work using other tools available, like speed adjustment, background removal (chroma key), and more.

Step6 After completing the edits, click the Export button. Choose to download it offline by selecting Local and choosing your preferred format. Make further changes in the settings.

Or, you can directly post the video to your linked YouTube account.

Step7 Tap the Export button.

## Final Words

Overall, Ryan Kaji saw great success with his stunning and engaging videos on his YouTube channel over the years. Also, he focused on other ventures, with the support of the team behind his channel, for income and editing work.

But, while starting, your funding will be less. It would help if you handled the video editing work on your own first, with reliable software like [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Also, use other analytics tools and strategies to improve your channel further.
