As for eBook lovers, when we asked about converting eBook formats, the recommended tool is usually Calibre or other online eBook converters. But if we use one of the tools to convert format, the conversion may sometimes fails, and you can see warning like "This book is DRMed and is not allowed to convert". It shows your uploaded books are DRM protected. Converting DRM files, we need another useful tool which supports DRM eBooks. This article talks about converting DRM eBooks complete guide. Hope it can help you.

### Converting Kindle DRM eBooks

As one of the largest eBook retailers, Amazon is popular among eBook lovers. We may often download Kindle books from Amazon website. But it's obvious that most of our downloaded Kindle books are DRM protected. Besides, Kindle books are in Amazon unique format, so we can only read them on Kindle device or app. If we want to read Kindle books on other eReaders that don't support Kindle format, such as Nook, Kobo, converting Kindle DRM eBooks to EPUB or PDF is the best way. How to? 

Converting Kindle DRM eBooks, we have to remove Kindle DRM first, you can read the guide [Kindle DRM Removal](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)for details.
