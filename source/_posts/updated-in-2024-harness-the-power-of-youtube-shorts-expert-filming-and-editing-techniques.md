That said, in the following sections you will learn everything about the **YouTube Shorts app**, and how it could help you gain more viewers for your YouTube channel.

## **Part 1: What Is YouTube Shorts?**

A short and quick answer to the question is, **YouTube Shorts** is a Tik Tok competitor developed by Google and can be accessed via the YouTube app on an Android or iOS device. In order to use the **YouTube Shorts app**, all you need to do is, sign in to your YouTube account on the YouTube app, and you are good to go.

### 1\. YouTube Shorts Release History

At the time of this writing, **YouTube Shorts** is still in the Beta phase, and there is a lot more that the developers at Google have yet to explore and discover. However, for now, the fully functional variant of the program is available only for users in India on Android and iOS platforms.

### 2\. YouTube Shorts Target Audience

A majority of people who can be called the target audience for YouTube Shorts are the artists and creators looking forward to getting noticed. Some of them could also be among those who wish to become an influencer, or get their YouTube channel more subscribers to be able to become eligible for YouTube Partnership Program.

And of course, the viewers and subscribers cannot be left alone when talking about the target audiences of YouTube Shorts as without them, there’s no point in creating short videos in the first place.

The type of contents that the viewers expect to see as YouTube Shorts could include:

* Entertainment – While movies are of longer duration, roasting the characters in it, or explaining some other stuff to the subscribers could be one of the things that could keep the viewers engaged
* Gaming – Some extraordinary gaming tips, tricks, and skills can be demonstrated in a short video
* How-To – A couple of brief how-to illustrations can yet be another attraction for DIY-loving viewers
* Science and Technology – A short introduction of upcoming gadgets or applications along with their usability can be explained within the timeframe of 60 seconds as well

In addition to the above, a few other categories could be People and Places, Music, Domestic and Wild Animals, Education, etc.

### 3\. YouTube Shorts Content Requirements

While creating **YouTube Shorts**, there are certain guidelines that must be followed. These points include:

* **YouTube Shorts** videos must not be more than 60 seconds long
* The videos must be vertically shot, and must not be in the landscape orientation
* You can have multiple short videos clubbed together. However, the total length of the final video must not exceed 60 seconds in duration
* While posting **YouTube Shorts** videos, the title or the description must contain ‘#shorts’ in it

Certain things that you must keep in mind while creating **YouTube Shorts** include:

* **YouTube Shorts** cannot be monetized. However, they can serve as a good medium to attract and redirect the audiences to your main YouTube channel which may contain several videos that are eligible for monetization.
* The number of views and the total playtime of the **YouTube Shorts** videos DO affect your YouTube channel statistics

### 4\. Where People Can Find YouTube Shorts

As mentioned earlier, **YouTube Shorts** can be accessed by launching the YouTube app on your Android or iOS device. You can use **YouTube Shorts** by clicking the **+** (**Add**) icon present at the bottom.

### Analyzing common monetization indicators

#### 1.Ads on Your Videos

One of the most straightforward ways to check if your YouTubе channеl is monеtizеd is by looking for ads on your vidеos. Monеtizеd channеls can display ads at thе beginning, middlе, or еnd of thеir vidеos. Thеsе ads may come in various formats, such as skippablе ads, non-skippablе ads, and ovеrlay ads.

To check for ads on your vidеos, watch some of your own content. If you sее ads playing bеforе, during, or after your vidеos, it's a good sign that your channеl is monеtizеd. Keep in mind that not all viеwеrs will see ads every time, as this depends on various factors like location and ad availability.

#### 2\. Sponsorships and Paid Promotions

Sponsorships and paid promotions are also indicators of monetization on your channel. Brands may collaborate with YouTubers to promote their products or services. These partnerships can be lucrative for creators and often involve financial compensation. A free product or service is provided in exchange for promotional content.

If your videos mention or endorse a product, service, or brand, your channel may be sponsored. Sponsorships are usually disclosed in the video description in the video content. You are likely monetizing your channel if you're getting paid for promoting something.

#### 3\. Merchandise Links in Descriptions

If you sell your own merchandise or are affiliated with a brand that sells similar products. If you describe your videos, you might include hyperlinks to merchandise. Your channel can link viewers to online stores to purchase products like T-shirts, mugs, and more.

Check your video descriptions for any merchandise links. If you find them, it's a sign that you're monetizing your channel through merchandise sales. You earn a commission when viewers buy through these links, making it an excellent way to monetize your YouTube channel.

#### 4\. Channel Memberships

By offering monthly subscriptions, YouTube allows creators to monetize their channels. You can invite subscribers to join your channel as members. They'll get members-only content, custom badges, emojis, and more. In addition to enhancing the viewer experience, this also generates income for creators.

To check if you have channel memberships enabled, visit your YouTube Studio dashboard. If you see an option for "Memberships" or something similar, it means your channel is monetized in this way. Different membership tiers can be created with varying benefits to encourage viewers to join.

To see if you have Super Chat enabled, go to your YouTube Live dashboard. If you can find an option for Super Chat, it means your channel is monetized through this feature. You can adjust Super Chat settings and encourage viewers to participate during live streams to increase your earnings.

![monetization status](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-check-if-your-youtube-channel-is-monetized-correctly-3.jpg)

### Analyzing common monetization indicators

#### 1.Ads on Your Videos

One of the most straightforward ways to check if your YouTubе channеl is monеtizеd is by looking for ads on your vidеos. Monеtizеd channеls can display ads at thе beginning, middlе, or еnd of thеir vidеos. Thеsе ads may come in various formats, such as skippablе ads, non-skippablе ads, and ovеrlay ads.

To check for ads on your vidеos, watch some of your own content. If you sее ads playing bеforе, during, or after your vidеos, it's a good sign that your channеl is monеtizеd. Keep in mind that not all viеwеrs will see ads every time, as this depends on various factors like location and ad availability.

#### 2\. Sponsorships and Paid Promotions

Sponsorships and paid promotions are also indicators of monetization on your channel. Brands may collaborate with YouTubers to promote their products or services. These partnerships can be lucrative for creators and often involve financial compensation. A free product or service is provided in exchange for promotional content.

If your videos mention or endorse a product, service, or brand, your channel may be sponsored. Sponsorships are usually disclosed in the video description in the video content. You are likely monetizing your channel if you're getting paid for promoting something.

#### 3\. Merchandise Links in Descriptions

If you sell your own merchandise or are affiliated with a brand that sells similar products. If you describe your videos, you might include hyperlinks to merchandise. Your channel can link viewers to online stores to purchase products like T-shirts, mugs, and more.

Check your video descriptions for any merchandise links. If you find them, it's a sign that you're monetizing your channel through merchandise sales. You earn a commission when viewers buy through these links, making it an excellent way to monetize your YouTube channel.

#### 4\. Channel Memberships

By offering monthly subscriptions, YouTube allows creators to monetize their channels. You can invite subscribers to join your channel as members. They'll get members-only content, custom badges, emojis, and more. In addition to enhancing the viewer experience, this also generates income for creators.

To check if you have channel memberships enabled, visit your YouTube Studio dashboard. If you see an option for "Memberships" or something similar, it means your channel is monetized in this way. Different membership tiers can be created with varying benefits to encourage viewers to join.
