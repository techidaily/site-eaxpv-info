**Steps on How to Use Filmora**

This is an app that is best suited to those starting in video editing and requires the use of an easy-to-use app that can as well deliver quality work. Filmora is an application that was made with the armature editors in mind and is one they should consider while looking for a program to work with. It features some of the essential tools one would require and it is easy to learn how to navigate through it.

Installation Steps

* Click the icon in the center of the Media Library to add files directly.
* Go File > Import Media > Import Media Files.
* Drag and drop to the ‘media library’ directly.

When importing a media file and Filmora asks you to create a proxy file to speed up the editing process. Select “Yes” to have a fast video editing experience.

You can also import video clips using your Touch Bar controls if your computer has Touch Bar.

Record a media file

Apart from the videos shot by your digital devices, you can also directly import media files by recording video from your webcam, screen recording your computer, and a voice-over recording.

Computer screen recording:

Click the "Record" option, and choose "Record PC Screen" to get the built-in Wondershare Screen Recorder. Hit the red button to get started. To finish recording click on F9

Record videos from webcam:

Also, click the “Record” option, and choose “Record from Webcam”. In the recording pop-up window, select the red button, it will start the recording process and is also the button to choose when you want to stop recording. You will then select OK to save the recorded video clip.

Record voice-over:

Choose "Record a voiceover" on the Record menu. It would be better to connect a microphone to your Mac for a better result. Hit the Record button, and it leaves you 3 seconds to get ready.

All media files recorded are automatically saved in the “Media Library”, in case of further editing, you can drag them to the timeline.
