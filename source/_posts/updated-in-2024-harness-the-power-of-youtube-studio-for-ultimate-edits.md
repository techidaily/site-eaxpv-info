Using a template on Canva is as easy as clicking on the one you want and then dragging and dropping in your own images (if you don‚Äôt want to use theirs) and changing what the text says.

Although Canva is free to use, and includes many free options for graphics and stock photos, it does also have some premium images and clip art which cost $1 each to use. Making a free banner is as easy as making sure none of the paid elements are in your design (they‚Äôre watermarked, so you‚Äôll know).
