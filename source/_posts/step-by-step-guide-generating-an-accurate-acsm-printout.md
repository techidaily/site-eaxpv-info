E-readers have made it possible to carry and read a large number of eBooks conveniently. You can carry just an e-reader and access countless eBooks without the burden of heavy paper books. This is incredibly convenient. However, there are times when you might still need to print your files. For instance, you might want to print an ACSM file if it contains a cookbook. Imagine cooking in the kitchen—it's inconvenient to handle an e-reader while trying to follow a recipe. On the other hand, if you print the ACSM recipe, you can easily refer to it while cooking.

Additionally, you might miss the scent of ink on paper or want to read paper books to give your eyes a break after prolonged exposure to an e-reader screen.

If you're unsure how to print your ACSM file, follow these steps to learn how.

![print acsm file](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/steps-of-printing-acsm-file.png)

### Firstly, open ACSM file and download it 

As you know,**[acsm file](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)** is not an actual ebook but its function is strictly limited to e-books. You usually receive this acsm file after you purchase ebook from many online stores. Since it is used by Adobe to protect its digital rights management, it can't be opened directly unless you apply Adobe Digital Editions. Here are the detailed steps for opening acsm file in ADE and downloading it.

**Step 1:** [Download Adobe Digital Edition](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html) (ADE) and install it.

**Step 2:** **Authorize your Adobe ID**

If it's the first time you used ADE, you will see a dialogue box to require you to enter your Adobe ID to authorize your present computer. Or you can create an Adobe account to register if you haven't got an Adobe ID.

After you input your Adobe ID and password, tag "Authorize" to activate it.

![authorize your Adobe ID](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/authorize-your-adobe-ID .png)

**Step 3:** **Open acsm file with ADE and download it**

Find the acsm file in your computer and double click it. Then it will be opened with Adobe Digital Editions by default. If it comes out with another software, you can choose to open it with ADE by clicking the right mouse to select the open mode. 

After this, it will start to download the actual ebook automatically. The actual ebook you finally get is EPUB or PDF format.

### Secondly, convert ACSM to pdf

After the downloading step finished, your epub or pdf file will be automatically saved in your computer. Since you want to print your acsm out, I advise you to convert it to pdf if you have got epub file. Because epub format owns the effect of re-flow while pdf is fixed format. 

To make clear the file you have downloaded is epub or pdf, you need to find your downloaded file in your computer first. 

**For Windows:** ...\\ My Documents (Documents)\\ My Digital Editions...

**For Mac:** Users\\ Your computer name\\ Digital Editions...

Now you open your PDF or epub with Adobe Digital Editions and try to print it. You'll find the print option is greyed out as below picture. What's wrong?

**Importance Notice:** Although you have downloaded .acsm file to pdf or epub, you are not allowed to print the pdf, or epub files because they are protect by adobe DRM. That's the real reason that your books are not printable. You can check whether your pdf or epub is printable or not by right clicking the book cover>>Item info.
