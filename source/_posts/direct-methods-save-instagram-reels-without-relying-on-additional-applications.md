##  How to Download Instagram Reels

 Previously, if you found an interesting [Reel on Instagram](https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-harness-the-potential-of-gratuitous-timer-tools/) that you wanted to save to your gallery, you'd need to visit a third-party downloader website or use a separate app on your smartphone. These services are often riddled with ads and scams. However, Instagram recently added a built-in download option for [Reels](https://app-tips.techidaily.com/comprehensive-itunes-backup-strategies-learn-the-best-techniques-for-protection/). This means you can now download Reels directly on your smartphone without using any external tools.

 To begin, first, find the Reel you want to save on your phone. Then, tap the share icon and choose "Download" from the menu that pops up.

Close 

 Instagram will begin downloading the Reel. The download process will take some time, depending on the Reel's length and quality. Once the download is complete, you can find the video in your phone's gallery from where you can share it with friends using other sharing apps you have on your device.

##  Why Can’t You Download Some Reels?

 Even if you follow the steps above correctly, you still might find some Reels that don't show the download option. This usually happens with Reels that have been uploaded privately. In other words, if the Reel you're trying to download is from a [private account](https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-dynamic-speaker-analysis-episode-8/) that allows you to follow it, you won't be able to download the video.

 In addition to that, Instagram has a setting that allows the uploaded to prevent people from downloading the Reel even if their account is public. To configure this setting yourself, go to your Instagram profile, tap the hamburger icon in the top-right corner, then select Settings and Privacy > Sharing and Remixes> Allow people to download your Reels.

 If the person whose Reels you're trying to download has this option disabled, then you won't be able to download their Reels even if their account is public.

 These are the two main reasons why some Reels might not show the download option. However, there may be times when the download option doesn't show up due to a temporary bug or glitch. In that case, you can try [updating the Instagram app](https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unveiling-the-real-value-in-cloud-storage-charges/). Alternatively, you can [contact Instagram support](https://help.instagram.com/270447560766967/?helpref=topq) for help.

 That's all about how you can download Reels from Instagram. Pretty easy, right? However, do note that the downloaded Reel would include the username of the person who uploaded it. This is a good practice by Instagram. This way, everyone the Reel is being shared with will know who the creator is so they can reach that account for more Reels.
