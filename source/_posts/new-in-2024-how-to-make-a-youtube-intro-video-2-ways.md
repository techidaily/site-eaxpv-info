## Part 1: How to Make a YouTube Intro Video with Filmora

With Wondershare Filmora, you can create your custom intros from scratch, i.e., even if you don’t have an existing image or footage to start with. You can follow the method given below to learn **how to make YouTube intro** with Filmora:

### Step 1: Add Intro Background to Filmora

Launch Wondershare Filmora, go to **Media** tab at the top, select the **Sample Colors** category from the left pane.

Notice all the existing solid and gradient colors in the **Media** library in the right, hover the mouse over the tile of the color you want to use as a background, and click the **+** icon that appears in the center to add it to the timeline.

![use sample colors as intro background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sample-colors-media-in-filmora9.jpg)

**Note:** The default duration of such solids is 5 seconds. You can increase or decrease this time by dragging the right handle of track in the timeline.

Alternatively, you can also use your own background image or video clip by selecting the **Project Media** category from the left pane, clicking anywhere inside the **Media** window, and then importing your favorite media file to Filmora. After importing, you can follow the procedure given above to add it to the timeline.

### Step 2: Select and Add Audio/Sound Effect to YouTube Intro

With audio in the YouTube intro, your video will be more recognizable. If you have watched PewDiePie ‘s video, you’ll find that even though he changed the images on the intro often, he keeps the music and sound the same in the intro.

## Edit your YouTube video with Filmora

Furthermore, Filmora is excellent for editing short videos and making short video advertisements.

Wondershare Filmora's primary features include 4K editing support, GIF compatibility, noise removal, color tuning, a powerful text editor, an audio mixer, video stabilization, scene identification, and audio equalization. Users can edit and export videos with a resolution of up to 4K, thanks to the 4K editing support function.

However, the video streaming site features a large, though difficult-to-find, a library of legal free movies. Not talking about strangely uploaded, blurry, shaky movies. Along with viral stars and adorable animal montages, genuine, 100 percent free (and good) movies are available.

Have you seen everything on Netflix? Does nothing pique your interest in Hulu or Amazon Prime Video? Can I entice you with a free YouTube movie?

To watch full-length movies for free, you don't need to rent a movie or sign up for a YouTube Premium subscription. Hundreds of movies are accessible for free on YouTube if you don't mind having your movie-watching pleasure interrupted by the occasional ad.

If you're willing to pay to stream, YouTube boasts as large a collection of new movies as anyone. However, the video streaming site features a large, though difficult-to-find, a library of legal free movies. Not talking about strangely uploaded, blurry, shaky movies. Along with viral stars and adorable animal montages, genuine, 100 percent free (and good) movies are available.
