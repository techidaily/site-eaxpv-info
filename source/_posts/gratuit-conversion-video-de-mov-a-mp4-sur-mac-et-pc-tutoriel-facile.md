## Part 1\. Reasons for Ripping DVD to MKV

**![](https://www.winxdvd.com/resource/../seo-img/general-img/a11.png)1\. Ripping DVD will Remove DVD Copy Protections** 

Similar to Blu-ray, DVD disc is also equipped with a variety of protections to prevent DVD content from illegal use. The most popular encryption techs include CSS encryption, Sony ARccOS encryption, RCE Region protection, Disney X-project DRM, region code etc. DVD rippers can bypass DVD copy protections and deliver a DRM-free file. But sometimes you may encounter errors while working with [DVD ripping freeware](https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/) like MakeMKV, HandBrake and Freemake Video Converter. 

**![](https://www.winxdvd.com/resource/../seo-img/general-img/a10.png)2\. DVD to MKV Backup can Reserves All DVD Content** 

If you have ever [encoded DVD movies into MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/), AVI, or MPEG format, and been slightly frustrated with the loss of DVD extra elements, then you can switch to MKV as the DVD backup format. MKV is able to contain all detailed chapter information, sub-chapters, titles, multiple audio and video streams, subtitles, attachments and custom metadata.

**![](https://www.winxdvd.com/resource/../seo-img/general-img/a7.png)3\. MKV Container Is as Universal as MP4 with High Quality**

Since MKV supports any type of video/audio tracks and subtitles inside, and is quite efficient for storage and streaming, it's widely used on video transmitting. Usually, common DVD rippers can help rip a 4-8 GB DVD movie to a digital file in hundreds of MB, but you will get much quality loss. Only some seasoned DVD to MKV backup tools balance well on video file size and DVD ripping speed.
