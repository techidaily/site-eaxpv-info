Mobi format was invented by the French company Mobipocket and was originally used as an ebook format for their MobiPocket Reader application. The company was aquired by Amazon in 2005 and since then mobi format has been used in Amazon's Kindle. The Amazon's eBook formats, including .azw, .azw1, and .azw3, use the MOBI format but incorporate a proprietary DRM scheme to prevent unauthorized users from viewing or copying an eBook that is contained in the MOBI file. Mobi files usually have .mobi extension, or they may have .prc or .pdb extension as the format was originally designed for Palm Pilot PDAs. The extension can be changed by the user to either of the accepted forms.

MOBI files support things like bookmarking, JavaScript, frames, and adding notes and corrections. They are supported by various eReaders, tablets, PDAs, and desktop computer applications. If you own a Kindle device you can read the mobi files on the Kindle device with perfect reading experience. But have you wondered what programs can open mobi files on your computer if you don’t have a Kindle device or other supported eReaders? Luckily you’ll be introduced **the 4 best MOBI readers for Windows** in this article. You can enjoy the best possible mobi reading effect with these programs installed on your PC.

### Kindle for PC (1.19.1 and above)

Click here to download [the latest version of Kindle for PC (1.19.1 and above)](https://amazon.com/kindlepcdownload-accessibility).

Amazon's Kindle for PC is a free e-book reader and manager for Windows PCs. You can read e-books, manage your library and collections, and shop for new titles, just like you can with your handheld Kindle device, only in a layout optimized for Windows. With the Amazon Kindle app installed, you can get the best reading experience available on your PC. It automatically synchronizes your last page read and annotations between devices with Whispersync. You’re able to create new highlights, notes, and bookmarks and manage those created on your Kindle. Full screen reading view, color modes, and brightness controls offer an immersive reading experience. Besides reading MOBI files on the app, it also supports the new AZW4 format used for textbooks. Apart from reading ebooks on Kindle for PC, you can also shop for books among over 400,000 books available in the Kindle Store.

![Kindle-for-PC](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Kindle-for-PC2.png)

[Kindle for PC with Accessibility Plugin](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200596280) is a Windows only addon which provides the following accessibility features: text-to-speech reading, voice-guided menu navigation, large font sizes, high contrast reading mode, keyboard navigation, and accessible shortcuts. In order to use the text-to-speech feature, an external screen reader program must be installed and running on the Windows PC. Kindle for PC with Accessibility Plugin is compatible with Microsoft Narrator, JAWS and NVDA. The latest version of Kindle for PC (1.91 and above) integrates the accessibility plugin and supports screen readers and text-to-speech.

CONs of the app: the content column in the left sidebar cannot be folded; all open files will be copied to Kindle content directory; epub files are not supported.

### Book Bazaar Reader for WIN 8 & WIN 10

Get and install Book Bazaar Reader via [Microsoft Windows 10 Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/book-bazaar-reader/9wzdncrfjcqv?rtc=1) and [Microsoft Windows 8 Store](http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/app/book-bazaar-reader/bf4896b8-4211-4817-9bd8-a5e2bf92fdca).

[Book Bazaar Reader](http://www.refrelent.com/) is a full feature eBook Reader app for Windows 8 and Windows 10\. After trying plenty of Mobi Readers for Windows, I settle on Book Bazaar Reader. Personally I like this app most because it gives me the best reading experience on Windows. You can read ebooks in EPUB, MOBI, FB2, PDF, TXT formats with Book Bazaar Reader. Thousands of free books from multiple sources of open publications, such as Guttenberg, Flibusta, FeedBooks, FreeBooks, ManyBooks, etc. are available for downloading. You can import books from local files and by direct web URLs.

![Book-Bazaar-Reader](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Book-Bazaar-Reader.jpg)

It offers great reading experience custom fonts, nice page turning experiences, and high performance with big book formatting, rotating and resizing. Margins and line spacing can be adjusted. Day reading mode and night reading mode are selectable.

Book library organizer allows with different ways of sorting and grouping (by authors, genres, titles, sizes, publishing time, download time). Most recently read books are easily available using "I am reading" list.

It allows for the reader to set bookmarks, highlight pieces of text with different colors and add notes. You can copy and share individual highlights and quotes as well as the whole collection of marks from a book. Also you’ll like how it treats PDFs nearly the same as MOBI files in that it pulls the cover page as the book's icon.

Cons of the app: Ads are inserted in the free version of the app; missing dictionary look up feature.

### SumatraPDF Reader

Click here to download[the latest version of SumatraPDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/download-free-pdf-viewer.html).

Sumatra PDF is a free PDF, eBook (ePub, Mobi), XPS, DjVu, CHM, Comic Book (CBZ and CBR) reader for Windows. It’s a lightweight program which prioritizes simplicity of user interface and speed of opening files. Sumatra PDF is powerful, small, portable and starts up very fast. It has all the basic features you need and none of the fancy extras that you don't.

![SumatraPDF-Reader](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/SumatraPDF-Reader.png)

<a href="https://funwhole.sjv.io/c/5597632/1702887/17189" target="_top" id="1702887"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17189-1702887" border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1702887/17189" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
The program has a plain, intuitive interface, with a few menus and a toolbar across the top. The minimalist tool bar of SumatraPDF Reader provides easy access to zooming in and out, selecting single page, skipping back and forth between pages, facing page, and printing. It also lets you rotate pages and view PDFs or ebook files in full screen or presentation modes. A search box lets you locate text within PDFs or ebook files, and there's even an option that will launch your default e-mail application and let you automatically attach the PDF or ebook file to a new e-mail. 

Overall, if you're looking for a sleek and simple PDF and ebook reader and organizer, SumatraPDF is worth a try. 

Cons of the app: Advanced options are tricky to edit: It’s an HTML file that you need to edit.

### Mobipocket Reader

Click here to download[Mobipocket Reader 6.2 Build 608 for Windows](http://www.technorange.com/wp-content/uploads/mobireadersetup.msi).

Mobipocket Reader is one of the best desktop eBook readers which allows you to read eBooks and news on your computer. It’s flexible, intuitive, lightweight and easy-to-use. The app combines the functions of an eBook reader and a RSS client in the same interface. It organizes your eBook library, collect RSS feeds and your personal documents all in one place. It can read almost all the DRM free mobi files that you imported into it.

![Mobipocket-Reader](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Mobipocket-Reader.jpg)

When reading a book with Mobipocket Reader, you can change the font, color and background as well as view in full screen mode. You can highlight certain passages, add notes, and import links. You can turn pages by clicking cursor keys, pressing space bars or moving mouse. It allows you to subscribe to multiple RSS feeds and to read the latest headlines in the same interface. The amazing app also combines with the ability to convert and to send eBooks to your mobile device.

Previously users could shop for books from Mobipocket online store until Amazon shut down its retail and distribution operation in 2011\. Now when you access Mobipocket Official Website you can find the announcement stated “Mobipocket and its services are no longer available. To shop for digital books we suggest visiting Amazon.com to continue your reading experience.”. Given the situation the program Mobipocket Reader hasn’t been updated since 2013\. Nevertheless it’s still an excellent eBook Reader for Windows.

Cons of the app: Dictionary doesn’t work on installation; the app isn’t maintained anymore.

### Supplementary Remarks

Besides the top 4 Mobi Readers for Windows I mentioned above, there’re other less superior programs can read mobi files on PC such as Calibre, FBReader, Icecream Ebook Reader, ect. 

[Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/download%5Fwindows) is more than an ebook reader, it’s a complete management software. You can read ebooks, convert ebook formats and organize your library with Calibre. It even has an inbuilt portal from where you can download DRM free and DRM restricted ebooks distributed by a variety of different ebook online stores. However, for the sole purpose of reading mobi files, Calibre seems a little bloated. Compared with the above 3 Mobi Readers, Calibre opens mobi files comparatively slow. It performs sluggishly or even crashes when opening a large size of mobi file. 

[FBReader](https://fbreader.org/) is great on Android but is barely satisfactory on Windows. It’s a lightweight, smooth, and no-frills program, but it has a prominent flaw for the Windows version: it crashes when you browse your SD card, and it doesn’t work with OneDrive. FBReader for Windows has not been maintained by the developer or publisher any more.

[Icecream Ebook Reader](https://icecreamapps.com/Download-Ebook-Reader/) is actually a decent Windows based ebook reader. It enables you to read ebooks in EPUB, MOBI, FB2, PDF and other popular formats. It also features the ability to turn pages, use bookmarks, add notes, translate text, search your library, track reading progress and more. However, the free version allows only 10 ebooks inside its digital library, and you cannot edit the metadata about them.

P.S. Please note that only DRM free files can be supported by these apps. If the MOBI files contain DRM restriction, you need to strip DRM from the MOBI files before reading them on these apps. If you want to read DRM protected MOBI files with these tools, I highly recommend you to install the best eBook DRM removal and converter – [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/)!

You can download the software for free by clicking the links below. The trial version of Epubor Ultimate handles DRM removal and format conversion of 20% contents of your original eBooks. If you want to get 100% contents of eBooks decrypted and convert their formats losslessly, you need to upgrade Epubor Ultimate to the paid version.
