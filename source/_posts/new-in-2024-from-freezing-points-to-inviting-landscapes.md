## Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos

Now, before we dive into the examples themselves and the tutorial on how to make the best backgrounds yourself, here are several factors you must consider before proceeding.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Content Relevance

As a video creator, you must ensure to be consistent with your elements. This includes your **background tune for YouTube videos.** For example, if you’re talking about books in your video, including a bookshelf in the winter background makes all the difference.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2092236/16384" target="_top" id="2092236"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2092236" border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="329"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2092236/16384" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Audience Appeal

If you already have an audience, regardless of its size, you should definitely consider what they like and don’t like. You should then leverage this information to create highly appealing content for them and adjust your background scenery accordingly.

<a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892108/21290" target="_top" id="1892108"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892108" border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892108/21290" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Lighting and Visibility

Another thing you must ensure is to keep your background simple and not too distracting. Remember, even though you have the **best background for YouTube videos**, you still need to realize that it’s not the main focus of the video. It’s just there to make it better.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Personal Branding

If you want to improve your brand identity and get your name known by more people, incorporate your logo, name, or something similar in the background. It will have a small but meaningful impact, and it’s easy to do.

### Editing

If you plan to shoot a YouTube live background and not some stock images or videos, then you must make sure it has enough headroom for editing later on. The best option here is to use a **green screen background for YouTube videos**.

The next screen will list down number of videos that have been uploaded to your YouTube Account and the ones which are already synched with Dailymotion will have a check against their name. The ones which are not synched will have a box; you can simply check it and click on ‘Synch videos’ at the top right corner.

It will ask for your email address to get notifications, put in your email ID and click on Sync. Once they are active and synched you will receive a notification on your email with a subject ‘Done reuploading’ followed by the tile of the video. This simply means that you need not upload any video separately on dailymotion, you can simply synch it with YouTube and put in your efforts of uploading only once!
