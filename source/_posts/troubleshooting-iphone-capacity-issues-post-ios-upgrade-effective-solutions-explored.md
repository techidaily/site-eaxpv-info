## iPhone Runs out of Storage Space - The Real Culprits You Don't Know

It's widely acknowledged even the 64/128GB iPhone will frustrate you at some critical moment such as software update due to the storage shortage. You are often told the **Apps such as Facebook and Instagram** you install on iPhone slowly drain away the amount of your iPhone storage, the **caches and cookies** secretly steal away the space on iPhone, and your accumulated **photos and music** are eating up your bare space. These are activities are blamed for iPhone storage full problem. 

However, they are not necessarily the main culprit. Frankly, **large video files** cause not enough space on iPhone. According to Apple, iPhone introduces SE/6S/7 (Plus) with the support of 4K 30fps video recording to Apple lovers who pursue higher resolution. Now the latest iPhone even shoots footage with resolution up to 40 60fps. However, there is a problem. iPhone makes every picture crisp and sharp, but at the sacrifice of a large amount of data needed to store on iPhone, even with the newest [HEVC](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) supported to half file size for iPhone video compared with H.264\. But this doesn't really take the strain off iPhone storage.

![iPhone storage full problem](https://www.macxdvd.com/mobile/article-image/iphone-storage-full.jpg) 

 According to test, a minute iPhone 40 60fps video in HEVC takes up 400MB storage. That means 1h20min video in the same setting will theoretically use up the 32gb iPhone space, even with nothing installed on the smartphone. Of course, we don't mean you should not shoot any video footage. We mean you can either [compress the large video files](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) to a smaller size or transfer video to your computer as backup before you delete them. Just follow the tutorial below to fix iPhone not enough storage problem. 

## Solution 1\. Transfer Media Files from iPhone to Computer as Backup and Delete Them
