### Method 2: Make your Kindle books convertible

If you want to read kindle books on other eReaders, such as Kobo glo, Sony eReader, Nook Simple Touch, etc, for you can't install apps on e-ink readers, so we must make our books convertible and transferable to Kindle.

Here are steps for you about how to make kindle books convertible. At first let me tell you the reason **why we have to convert kindle books**.

* Kindle books are with DRM protection
* Kindle books are with Kindle format, not common epub or pdf

The DRM problem is one of the obstacles that prevent us reading kindle books on any other devices. And , as you know, non-Kindle devices, such as Kobo, Nook, iPad, and so on, their common ebook formats are EPUB and PDF. So we need a tool to help us strip drm from kindle and convert kindle to pdf or epub. You can search the Internet to find a good tool, here I write my suggestion [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/).
