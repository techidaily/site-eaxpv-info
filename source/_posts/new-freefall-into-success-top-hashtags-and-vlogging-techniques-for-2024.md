iMovie is a tool developed by Apple for video editing designed to help users create unique, fun videos quickly. This outstanding video editor works only on Apple devices which includes macOS, iOS, and iPadOS. It embodies excellent tools for a media organization, color grading, soundtracks, and green-screen effects for your videos. To crown it all, it supports a few media formats.

If your media source is unavailable on your device, it could be since iMovie doesn't support the format, or it may be under the protection of **Digital Rights Management**.

Now, even though you've downloaded the songs from YouTube to listen to them offline, you are allowed to stream them within the music player only and not apply them to other media forms.

So, if you want to add YouTube music to iMovie, you must remove the DRM restrictions first before converting the YouTube song to a format supported by iMovie. A professional YouTube music downloader can help you with all of this.
