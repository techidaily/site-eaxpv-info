Workers of film and television filming have always been taking great efforts on stunning visual effects. From the groundbreaking Star Wars to the sensational Avatar, then 2012, Gravity to Furious 7, George Lucas, James Cameron and other Hollywood directors all devote themselves to provide us with a visual feast, constantly revolutionizing Hollywood's visual effects. And cinema attracts more and more attention from customers. Moviegoers, that's what we call them.

Well, how about TV producers? Any move? First of all, they released the [4K TV](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macxdvd.com%2Fmac-dvd-video-converter-how-to%2Fbest-4k-tv-from-samsung-sony-lg.htm), being on par with IMAX. That's just the very beginning. Recently, Japan announces that they set about to carry out 8K digital TV signal in 2024, which ensures us that what we see on 8K display TV is even sharper and better than IMAX in cinema. **What is 8K?** Does 8K TV really excel IMAX with respect to visual effects?

## Part 1-What is 8K? (8K vs 4K vs 2K vs FHD

**What is 8K?** What is 8K TV? It's too boring to explain 8K with various professional specifications for you, for it's really hard to understand. So I prefer the comparison method to illustrate you "What is 8K". Just as the old saying goes, comparison tells you the difference. Here I compare 8K with 2K, [4K, Full HD 1080P](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), majority of which are familiar to you so as to better digest the newcomer 8K.

![8K vs 4K vs 2K vs 1080P](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/8k-vs-4k-vs-1080p.jpg) 

8K vs 4K vs 2K vs 1080P

Take away the part of 8K resolution history, and let's cut to the chase. When you watch movies or TV shows on a full HD TV with 1080P, you can see the image with 2.07 million pixels; you will watch the video picture with 2.21 million pixels for the traditional digital cinema with 2K resolution; and you can enjoy the much sharper image with 8.85 million pixels in IMAX 4K cinema. More incredibly, 8K resolution **(7680×4320)** is **16** times bigger than 1080P FHD and **4** times as many as 4K UHD. See the picture on the right.

### What is 8K and 8K Advantage Compared with 4K 1080P?

Here I shows you the basic specifications of 8K TV, some of which might not be your cup of tea. If you are not interested in my rant, scroll down to where you want to stay for deeper understanding about what is 8K resolution.

| |  **8K UHD**  | **4K UHD**                   | **1080P FHD**                |                             |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Official name  | ITU-R Recommendation BT.2020 | ITU-R Recommendation BT.2020 | ITU-R Recommendation BT.709 |
| Resolution     | 7680 x 4320                  | 4096 x 2160                  | 1920 x 1080                 |
| Aspect Ratio   | 16:9                         | 16:9                         | 16:9                        |
| Color Space    | Rec. 2020                    | Rec. 2020                    | Rec. 709                    |
| Frame Rate     | 120p                         | 120p                         | 60p                         |

**PS**: Rec. 2022 shows more tolerance to Ultra HDTV, allowing frame rates of 120p, 60p, 59.94p, 50p, 30p, 29.97p, 25p, 24p, and 23.976p. One more thing: only progressive frame rates are allowed.

### 8K vs 4K vs 2K vs 1080P: Another Advantage of 8K

Another advantage of 8K high definition display is to have each pixel be indistinguishable from another to the human eye from a much closer distance. Based on the NHK, the ideal viewing distance is 0.75x the height of the display and the **viewing angle for 8K is 100°**, which brings much more exciting effects than 2K 4K with 55°viewing angle. (Below the table will show the specific distance according to the 8K TV size.)

| **8K TV Size**            | **42 inches** | **65 inches** | **85 inches** | **100 inches** | **240 inches** | **600 inches** |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Viewing distance (inches) | 15.6          | 24            | 31.2          | 37.2           | 88.8           | 220.8          |
| Viewing distance (feet)   | 1.3           | 2             | 2.6           | 3.1            | 7.4            | 18.4           |
