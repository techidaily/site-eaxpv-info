## What is an AVI File?

Before we get into the full episode, let’s start by understanding the definition of .AVI file.

AVI stands for audio video interleave. An AVI is a video container format that capture, store and play audio- videos. The AVI file extensions are abbreviated as .avi.

It was developed by Microsoft in 1992 and works based on Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF). Its users enjoy built-in support in every Microsoft Windows application.

AVI encodes its audio and video data on codecs like XviD, DivX and MPEG-2\. A codec is a software or hardware used to compress or decompress digital video.

If you have limited storage, avoid AVI files because they are non-compressed and occupy large space. Conversely, AVI format stores high-quality videos since they are less compressed.

Streaming videos from YouTube is expensive. To watch your favorite videos repeatedly, you have to download the YouTube videos and convert to AVI file.
