## Comparing the Upgrades From Kindle Paperwhite 1St Gen to 2Nd Gen

## Kindle Paperwhite 1 VS Kindle Paperwhite 2

Unlike Apple's ceremonious new product conference, Amazon choose to introduce their new generation of Kindle Fire HD and Kindle Paperwhite quietly on the homepage of amazon.com.

As we've already compiled a post about the [comparison between Kindle Fire HD and the new Kindle Fire HDX](https://www.slideshare.net/AdaWyy/kindle-fire-hdx-vs-kindle-fire-hd), today we are going to cover the comparison between Kindle Paperwhite 1 (2012) and Kindle Paperwhite 2 (2013).

### Screen

Compared to Kindle Paperwhite 1, the new model improved backlight, which Amazon says no glare in bright sunlight and more friendly to human eyes.

![kindle paperwhite 2 screen](http://www.epubor.com/images/popup-glare-compare.png)

And in practical test, the backlight in Kindle Paperwhite 2 is brighter than original, we will rarely need to turn up to brightness to more than 50%. White the text is darker, I guess this is another reason the new screen looks sharper. With the brighter backlight and darker text, we reads the contents more easily.

### Speed

This is an unimpressive but really important improvement in Kindle Paperwhite 2\. Many people don't like E-Ink Kindle because they think the response speed is too slow after getting used to operating on tablets.

Amazon says the new Kindle Paperwhite's processor is 25% faster (800MHz to 1GHz), which means the page turns are visibly quicker. Another significant speed improvement is the touch response speed, the new screen technology interacts more accurately to the smallest touches.

When I use the new Kindle Paperwhite, the wake up and book open speed is obviously quicker.

### Appearance

The front sides of original Kindle Paperwhite and new Kindle Paperwhite looks almost the same, I definitely can't differ them when they are put in front of me in sleep mode.

But the difference in appearance is pretty clear on the back sides. On the back of Kindle Paperwhite 1 the logo is Kindle, while it turns to Amazon on the Kindle Paperwhite 2\. And the new logo looks more striking than the old one.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Features

The Kindle Paperwhite 2 gets lots of new features. With the new Page Flip feature, we can flip page-by-page, chapter-by-chapter, or skip to some place in the book without losing your place. This makes the reading experience on Kindle get closer to read a practical book.

Another new feature is pretty a good news for those people who use Kindle to learn a language. Now when you are looking for the definition of a work, it will be automatically added to Vocabulary Builder, and you can check it anytime you like.

![kpw2-vocabulary-builder](http://www.epubor.com/images/vocabbuilder-2.png)

The new Kindle Match Book feature is the high-light among all these new stuff. For all your purchased or gonna-purchase paper book, you will be able to buy the Kindle edition for no more than $2.99.

### Shortcomings

The lack of headphone jack disables people to enjoy audio books; the web browser is still being a decoration; there is no auto-correct feature when taking notes, while it exists on Kindle for iOS app; and the most criticized rejection for EPUB files.

### Conclusion

All in all, the improvements of Kindle Paperwhite 2 is not that impressive, but it is still the best E-Ink eBook reading device in this industry.

However, if you already own an original Kindle Paperwhite, you need not to upgrade to the new model. If you haven't got a Kindle Paperwhite yet, what the heck are you waiting for?
