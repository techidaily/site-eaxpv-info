## Staying with My iPhone 14: Four Key Factors That Outweigh the Appeal of the iPhone 16 Pro - Insights From a Tech Expert

![iPhone 14 Pro Max](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/b24e2cd9cc6623acf38a13719651bfd5d43a38ca/2024/09/18/f584c0e6-7109-4913-9ef2-eab9e3f128a9/3.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

Maria Diaz/ZDNET

I've had an [iPhone 14 Pro Max](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-pre-owned-iphone-14-pro-max-5g-256gb-unlocked-space-black%2F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) since it launched two years ago. Like most of us, I regretfully admit that I'm on my phone most of the time when I'm not working or sleeping. I'm also a big fan of [generative AI](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/) tools, from [chatbots](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ai-chatbot/) to [image generators](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ai-image-generator/), though I am conscious of their [potential dangers](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-3-biggest-risks-from-generative-ai-and-how-to-deal-with-them/) and shortcomings. With all this considered, you'd think I'd be a shoo-in to upgrade my current smartphone for [an iPhone 16](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-compared-should-you-buy-the-standard-plus-pro-or-max/) with the new Apple Intelligence features, yet I'm not convinced.

**Also: [We've used every iPhone 16 model and here's our best buying advice for 2024](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/)**

There are compelling reasons to upgrade to an iPhone 16, even before considering the new Apple Intelligence features. The [iPhone 16 Pro Max](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-16-pro&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), for example, features the largest iPhone display yet, with thinner bezels and a taller design to allow the screen to stretch over 6.9 inches. 

But even with all the [Apple Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-intelligence-everything-to-know-about-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/) features we know about already, I'm not convinced to upgrade to a new iPhone yet. Though some things may get me there.

## 1\. We need a clearer Apple Intelligence timeline

Jason Hiner/ZDNET

If you're looking to the iPhone 16 to get all the flashy AI features Apple showed this summer, you'll have to wait. As it is now, the iPhone 16 lineup won't have all the Apple Intelligence features when it is widely available in stores on September 20\. However, we do know that some Apple Intelligence capabilities will come out with [iOS 18.1](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-intelligence-arrives-in-ios-18-1-developer-beta-heres-whats-new-for-iphone/), but its ensuing launch timeline is still largely unclear. 

**Also: [iPhone 16 Pro vs. iPhone 14 Pro: Is the latest model worth the upgrade?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-vs-iphone-14-pro-is-the-latest-model-worth-the-upgrade/)**

Most of the more attractive features of Apple Intelligence that Apple showcased during [WWDC](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-apple-will-announce-at-wwdc-today-apple-intelligence-siri-ios-18-more/)in June are supposedly coming later in 2025, which is hardly a convincing factor to fork over more money for a new phone in September 2024\. If you're looking for features like Genmoji, Image Playground, and the [ChatGPT](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-chatgpt-and-why-does-it-matter-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/) integration with Siri, you'll have to wait a few months.

## 2\. Uncertainty around on-device performance

Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

Many unknowns surround how Apple Intelligence features will perform on the [iPhone 15 Pro](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-pre-owned-iphone-15-pro-5g-128gb-unlocked-black-titanium%2F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1), [Pro Max](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-pre-owned-iphone-15-pro-max-5g-256gb-unlocked-black-titanium%2F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1), and the new iPhone 16 lineup. As Apple strives to continue its commitment to consumer privacy, it has advised that most of its AI features will run on-device. However, running AI models on-device, even the smaller models that Apple plans to run, can strain a smartphone's performance.

Apple Intelligence requires at least 8GB of RAM and an A17 or M1 Apple silicon processor or newer. While the iPhone 16 lineup is expected to run on an A18 Bionic chip and between 8GB and 12GB of RAM across the four different models, concerns about how much strain the CPU will endure are valid. The new [AI capabilities can also overheat the iPhone and drain its battery quicker](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-you-shouldnt-buy-the-iphone-16-for-apple-intelligence/), potentially reducing the device's lifecycle.

## 3\. The iPhone 16 is not enough of an upgrade on its own

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

The iPhone 14 was a big upgrade from the iPhone 13 by finally removing the notch in favor of the dynamic island. It also brought always-on capabilities and stand-by mode with the Pro models, followed by more customization options with iOS 17\. The iPhone 15 was an iterative upgrade, and though the iPhone 16 was planned to be a big upgrade again, most of this characterization hinges on the Apple Intelligence features.

But, the iPhone 16's Apple Intelligence features (when they arrive) are undoubtedly modest compared to [ChatGPT with GPT-4o](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-chatgpt/) and other AI tools available now. Other tools available now can do most of what Apple Intelligence promises; the difference is that the latter will run on-device and be personalized to the individual user.

## 4\. The iPhone 16 Pro is the same price as its predecessor… But is it worth it?

Prakhar Khanna/ZDNET

While the new iPhone 16 Pro is no more expensive than the iPhone 15 Pro, you're still paying for a new iPhone that does most of the same as the old one (at least for the first few months). Except for the Camera Control button, a better ultrawide camera, and a slightly larger screen, there are no huge differences between the iPhone 16 Pro and its predecessor.

The base iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are also the same price as the iPhone 15, starting at $799\. 

**Also: [I used my iPhone 15 Pro without a case for a year. Here's how it looks now](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-used-my-iphone-15-pro-without-a-case-for-a-year-heres-how-it-looks-now/)**

My Apple Intelligence-incompatible, lightning port-charging iPhone 14 Pro Max still performs just as well when I bought it two years ago. Amidst rumored iPhone 16 hardware upgrades, I've yet to find a reason to pay over $1,000 for a device that seems more of a slight upgrade than anything else.
