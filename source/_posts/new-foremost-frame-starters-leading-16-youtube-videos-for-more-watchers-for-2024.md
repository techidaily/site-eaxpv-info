A high-quality YouTube intro is the short clip at the beginning of a YouTube video that introduces the topic and, usually, the vlogger. **YouTube intro videos** usually include things like the name of your channel and your logo if you have one. The colors, music, and graphics you use in your intro should all be related to the theme and tone of your vlog.

Your intro is your chance to make a great first impression. A good one lets viewers know what kind of experience they can expect to have if they keep watching your video – whether it’s going to be funny or serious, for example. Having an awesome YouTube intro sequence also helps make your vlog look more like a real show instead of somebody just ranting at their webcam (not that you cannot make a great video that way!).

Luckily, making a sleek, professional-looking YouTube intro is easy. There are a lot of sites that offer template videos that are either very affordable or completely free. Or, you can make your own intro in your video editing program. In this article, you will learn how to make YouTube intros easily with Filmora. In the end, you will also know the best tools to make intros for YouTube.

## Part 1: What Makes Excellent YouTube Intros

Before you are making intros for YouTube, you should know the metrics of making a high-quality YouTube intro. Now, let's take a look at these important ingredients.

### 1\. Keep It Relevant

If your intro doesn’t fit in with the content that follows it people will get confused. Then probably, they will close your video. So your intros must be relevant to your video type. Funny YouTube intros for interesting lifestyle videos. High tech intros for reviews.

### 2\. Keep It Short

if it lasts too long people will get bored and click away. Five seconds is the ideal length. It can be shorter, but only once your channel gains some popularity and you need the intro less. You always need to remember to capture the viewer's attention first.

## 5 Tips for Making YouTube Intro Awesome

In this part, we'll share 5 ways to make your YouTube intro awesome.

**1\. Keep It Under 10 Seconds**

A 10-second intro should have lots of movement and exciting music to hold viewers’ attention. If your intro is more subdued then aim for more than 5 seconds.

**2\. Support Your Brand**

One of the most important things your intro can do is strengthen your personal brand. Your intro should look related to your channel art and video thumbnails, but even beyond that, it should match the tone of your content.

**3\. Use Music**

When there’s a silent pause in your video the chances of viewers clicking away increase. Make sure your intro includes music that suits the tone of your channel.

**4\. Include Your Channel Name**

Your channel name should be a huge, prominent, visual in your intro. This may seem like a given, but there are intros out there where the channel name is either small easy to overlook, or left out completely in favor of a logo.

**5\. Do a Cold Open**

On TV, shows usually have at least one scene before they play the theme song. That’s because nobody is tuning in just for the theme, or in your case the intro. Make sure you have at least a short clip before your intro to get viewers interested in the rest of your video. Beyond setting the tone for the rest of the video and introducing your topic, you can use this first clip to create a ‘curiosity gap’. This means generating curiosity and making your viewers feel invested in the video so they stay on the page.

## Part 1: Three Things to Check Before Starting Your Live

Before increasing your audience from **Google Meet live stream on YouTube**, make sure to check the below prerequisites.

### 1\. Available Google Workspace Edition

For **Google Meet YouTube live**, there are some requirements. The reason is that not every ordinary user of Google Meet can go for YouTube live streaming. To do so, you should buy any of the following pricing plans:

| **Google Workspace Pricing Plan**                      | **Price**                |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |

| Google One Subscribers with 2 TB or More Storage Space | Approx. $10/Month        |

**Note:** To know the exact pricing plans of Google Workspace, you have to contact Google Support.

### 2\. Approval of YouTube Channel for Live

To conduct live streaming, you must receive approval from the YouTube channel. For this, you must access your channel's YouTube Studio to perform the account verification. Now to activate and enable live streaming on your YouTube account, check the following steps:

Step1 Open your YouTube account and click on the "Profile" icon given at the top-right corner. After opening the Profile menu, click on the "YouTube Studio" option.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![choose the youtube studio option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/stream-google-meet-to-youtube-1.jpg)

Step2 A new window will be displayed on your screen. From the left panel, select "Content" among other options. Under the section called "Live," locate the "Get Started" option. Afterward, tap on the "Request" option and perform the verification steps for enabling live streaming. After 24 hours, you would get approval for live streaming on YouTube.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Connect your YouTube Channel to Google Meet

Once you get approval for live streaming, you can connect the YouTube channel to your Google Meet account. If the Host Management option is disabled, anyone within the Google Meet session can start live streaming. Conversely, only hosts or co-hosts can begin live streaming if this option is activated. Moreover, the individual who is starting the live stream from Google Meet will get connected to his YouTube channel.

Furthermore, you should use the same email address to enter the Google Meet that is connected to your YouTube account. By using the same email address, you can ensure smooth live streaming of Google Meet sessions to your YouTube channel. Also, you can only use laptops or desktops for initiating live streaming. The reason is that the **Google Meet live stream** on YouTube is not currently available on mobile devices.

## Part 2: How to Live Stream from Google Meet to YouTube

Once you have fulfilled all the requirements, you can start a live stream from Google Meet to YouTube. Check the following steps to execute the process:

Step1 To allow Google Meet sessions to live stream on YouTube, the Google Workspace admin must adjust some settings. To begin, log in to the “Admin Console” on the Workspace administrator account. Now go to "Apps" and access the "Google Workspace" option.

Step2 Afterward, click "Google Meet" and tap on the "Stream" option. Once done, click on the “Pencil” icon to open the Settings menu. Now enable the options "Let People Steam Their Meetings" and "Let People Use YouTube to Stream Meetings." Once done with the changes, click on the “Save” button.

Step3 Make sure that the Google account attached to your YouTube channel is capable of live streaming. Once done, go to your YouTube channel and tap on the “Create” button. Afterward, hit the “Live” button.

Step4 Now enter your Google Meet session and click on the “Activities” option. From the Activities menu, select "Live Streaming." Now a small menu will open for live-streaming settings. You can create a new event and add an event title. Make sure to choose the privacy options and desired language. Afterward, click on the “Start Streaming” option.

Step5 A small pop-up will appear that will tell you to remind your participants about live streaming. After reminding, click on the "Start" button. You can see the red "Live" button that will indicate to you the ongoing live-streaming session. Once you have concluded the live streaming by clicking on the "Stop Streaming" button, you can check the video analytics by visiting your YouTube channel.
