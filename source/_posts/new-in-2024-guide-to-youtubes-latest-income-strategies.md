6. **Flip lessons**– flipped learning is taking strong roots in most of the learning institutions and it becomes easy and efficient when using videos in the classroom.
7. **Teach when you are absent** – instead of missing class or having a guest teacher to stand in for you, you can simply record the lesson on your YouTube channel or simply give out instructions for the students to follow when you are away.
8. **Allow students to gain in-depth information**– by using YouTube in classroom, teachers are essentially allowing their students to dig deeper and comprehend the lessons better.
9. **Help the struggling students** – videos are great for the slow learners since they can rewind or play it at their own pace.
