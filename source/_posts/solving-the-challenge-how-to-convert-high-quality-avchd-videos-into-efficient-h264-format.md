_I am trying to convert AVCHD footage to a different codec, preferably H.264\. When I go to drag the footage in to MacX Free AVCHD Video Converter, the file bounces back and will not load in the application. How can I get the AVCHD footage to load in to the application? Are there restrictions on the format? Thanks so much!_

It's unsurprising that shutterbugs have a lot of AVCHD footages saved in their computers while it's surprising if they can import the AVCHD recordings on all the devices or editing software they have since many AVCHD video files, whether you shot by Canon, Sony or Panasonic, are incompatible with iPhone, iPad, Samsung, HTC, iMovie, iTunes, YouTube, etc. As a result, to convert AVCHD to H264 or other friendly format is deemed as indispensible for unlimited playback, editing or sharing.

### Reasons of Inability to Load AVCHD File before Conversion 

Generally, an excellent [video converter for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) and Windows can load a multimedia file rather than a folder. So if you've saved an MTS, M2TS or other files on your Mac, you can directly drag or load them onto your video converter software (if it supports converting MTS, M2TS, etc). But when it comes to an AVCHD file, loading error will occur, because AVCHD file is actually a folder which may look like a multimedia file on your Mac OS. Below are the screenshots of AVCHD file saved on Mac and Windows: 

As a result, if you directly drag AVCHD file in Mac OS, it will bounce back and not load in the program, even if you load the AVCHD file by click "Add File" button on the top left of the windows.

So to load AVCHD file and convert AVCHD MTS to H264, MP4, MOV, AVI, FLV, WMV, etc successfully, you'll have to do as follows to add the MTS file and finish the AVCHD video conversion.
