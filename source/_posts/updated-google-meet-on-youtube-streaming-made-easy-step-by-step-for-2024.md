**Note:** To know the exact pricing plans of Google Workspace, you have to contact Google Support.

### 2\. Approval of YouTube Channel for Live

To conduct live streaming, you must receive approval from the YouTube channel. For this, you must access your channel's YouTube Studio to perform the account verification. Now to activate and enable live streaming on your YouTube account, check the following steps:

Step1 Open your YouTube account and click on the "Profile" icon given at the top-right corner. After opening the Profile menu, click on the "YouTube Studio" option.

![choose the youtube studio option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/stream-google-meet-to-youtube-1.jpg)

Step2 A new window will be displayed on your screen. From the left panel, select "Content" among other options. Under the section called "Live," locate the "Get Started" option.

![tap on get ting started option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/stream-google-meet-to-youtube-2.jpg)

### 3\. Connect your YouTube Channel to Google Meet

Once you get approval for live streaming, you can connect the YouTube channel to your Google Meet account. If the Host Management option is disabled, anyone within the Google Meet session can start live streaming. Conversely, only hosts or co-hosts can begin live streaming if this option is activated. Moreover, the individual who is starting the live stream from Google Meet will get connected to his YouTube channel.

Furthermore, you should use the same email address to enter the Google Meet that is connected to your YouTube account. By using the same email address, you can ensure smooth live streaming of Google Meet sessions to your YouTube channel. Also, you can only use laptops or desktops for initiating live streaming. The reason is that the **Google Meet live stream** on YouTube is not currently available on mobile devices.

## Part 2: How to Live Stream from Google Meet to YouTube

Step1 To allow Google Meet sessions to live stream on YouTube, the Google Workspace admin must adjust some settings. To begin, log in to the “Admin Console” on the Workspace administrator account. Now go to "Apps" and access the "Google Workspace" option.

Step2 Afterward, click "Google Meet" and tap on the "Stream" option. Once done, click on the “Pencil” icon to open the Settings menu. Now enable the options "Let People Steam Their Meetings" and "Let People Use YouTube to Stream Meetings." Once done with the changes, click on the “Save” button.

Step3 Make sure that the Google account attached to your YouTube channel is capable of live streaming. Once done, go to your YouTube channel and tap on the “Create” button. Afterward, hit the “Live” button.

You can create a new event and add an event title. Make sure to choose the privacy options and desired language. Afterward, click on the “Start Streaming” option.

Step5 A small pop-up will appear that will tell you to remind your participants about live streaming. After reminding, click on the "Start" button. You can see the red "Live" button that will indicate to you the ongoing live-streaming session. Once you have concluded the live streaming by clicking on the "Stop Streaming" button, you can check the video analytics by visiting your YouTube channel.

#### 1. ** VidCon

**VidCon US:** June (Anaheim, California)

**VidCon Europe (Amsterdam):** March/April

**VidCon Australia:** August/September

![VidCon-On-Spot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/VidCon-On-Spot.jpg)

In 2017 over 30,000 YouTube enthusiasts – from fans to A-list creators – attended VidCon US, and that was thousands of more people than attended in 2016\. It’s hard to imagine that this event – the biggest convention for YouTube and online video – will do anything but grow over the next few years.

VidCon was founded by the Vlogbrothers in 2010 as a place for internet friends to meet in real life.

**Passes:**

There are three different types of passes for VidCon – the Community Track, the Creator Track, and the Industry Track.

The **Community Track** is for anyone who loves YouTube and wants a chance to see their favorite creators and meet other fans. Pricing ranges from $100 to $180, depending on how early you buy your ticket.

The **Creator Track** gets you to access to all the same events as the Community badges (except for the Meet & Greet Lottery\*), plus even more panels and workshops that will help you become a better creator. Pricing ranges from $150 to $250 depending on how early you buy your ticket.

The **Industry Track** is for anyone working in online video or video-adjacent industries, like advertising, branding, or talent management. There are panels on online marketing and working with influencers. Pricing ranges from $550 to $850, depending on when you buy your ticket.

 \*The Meet and Greet Lottery is a chance for anyone attending with a Community or Industry pass to meet their favorite creator. You rank the 15 creators you’d most like to meet according to how much you want to meet them. A computerized system will determine who gets into which Meet & Greet.

You have a two-week window (usually the first half of May) to submit your choices.

#### 2. ** PlayList Live

**Orlando, Florida:** April/May

**Tri-State (Secaucus, New Jersey):** September

**Washington DC:** September
