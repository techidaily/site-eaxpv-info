setInterval(function () { document.querySelector('#primary button\[aria-label="Action menu"\]').click(); var things = document.evaluate('//span\[contains(text(),"Remove from")\]', document, null, XPathResult.ORDERED\_NODE\_SNAPSHOT\_TYPE, null ); for (var i = 0; i < things.snapshotLength; i++) { things.snapshotItem(i).click(); } }, 1000);

Step4 In the last step, hit the **"Enter"** key to clear the Watch Later Playlist on YouTube. However, the process may take some time, depending on the number of videos in your playlist.

You are not limited to using any video file format. Several reasons may also compel you to **convert YouTube Shorts to MP4**. And this is the best move if you want to reach as many audiences as possible. Remember that users employ different devices and platforms to access such videos. These range from mobile phones, media players, emails, among others. Converting your videos to MP4 enables easy sharing on any platform effortlessly. The best converter tool, Filmora, serves the purpose quite well. You won’t experience any data loss and be assured that your audience gets the same quality as the original file.
