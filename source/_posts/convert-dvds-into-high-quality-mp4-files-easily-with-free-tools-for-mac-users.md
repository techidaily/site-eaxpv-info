### How to Free Rip DVD to MP4 on Mac with MacX DVD Ripper Free

The following tutorial will demonstrate how simple it is to convert DVDs to MP4 on Mac using MacX DVD Ripper Free.

**Preparatory work:**

* [Download MacX DVD Ripper Mac Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). It is fully compatible with macOS Sonoma and earlier. Then launch it.

**Step 1\. Load the source DVD.**

 Run MacX DVD Ripper Mac Free, and click "DVD Disc" to select the DVD you just inserted as the source DVD. Then, it will start analyzing your DVD. After that, it will automatically detect the correct title of the DVD, regardless of any copy protections on it, which most software can't do. 

![Load DVD into MacX DVD Ripper Mac Free Edition](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../seo-img/mac-how-to/dvd-free.png) 

**Step 2\. Choose "MP4 Video" as the output format.**

What's more, you can trim the DVD title. Simply click the Edit button, and then you'll find this feature. And you'll find the options to add external subtitles, crop, and expand video.

**Note:** Handbrake doesn't support protected DVDs on its own. If you plan to rip encrypted DVDs to MP4 using Handbrake, you have to download and install libdvdcss to work with it.

Its combination of speed, versatility, and customizability make it a popular option for users who want to convert DVDs to digital files for playback on a wide range of devices.

### How to Convert DVD to MP4 on Mac Free with HandBrake 

**Step 1.** Download and install HandBrake on your Mac.

 The latest HandBrake version, 1.7.2, is compatible with macOS 10.13 and later. For M1/M2 Macs, you should at least have Handbrake 1.4.0\. For macOS 10.12 and earlier, you should download an [older release](https://handbrake.fr/old.php). 

**Step 2.** Download libdvdcss for HandBrake.

To convert protected DVDs to MP4 using Handbrake, make sure you've installed libdvdcss on your computer for Handbrake to use. [Learn how to download libdvdcss on Mac here >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) 

This trick doesn't 100% work. If HandBrake cannot convert your DVD to MP4 on Mac, try other programs.

**Step 3.** Open Handbrake and click the Open Source button to load the source DVD. It will take some time to read the DVD data and find the correct titles. 

**Step 4.** Once the DVD is loaded, open the Title drop-down menu and select the movie title you want to rip. 

**Step 5.** Under Destination, specify a file name and a save path for the converted MP4 file.

**Step 6.** Click Preset and you will see Very Fast, Fast, HQ, and Super HQ. To free convert a DVD to MP4, you're suggested to choose either 480p or 576p based on the NTSC or PAL DVD. Don't select any higher resolutions as they won't do anything good to the output quality. 

**Step 7.** Next, choose MP4 as the output format. In the section below, you can further adjust the video codec, quality, crop, rotate, add filters, etc.

**Step 8.** Click Start on the toolbar to begin converting DVD to MP4 on Mac.

##  VLC Media Player - Convert CSS-protected DVD to MP4 on Mac

* **Input:** Unencrypted DVDs, ISO image, Video\_TS folder, video files

* **Latest version:** 3.0.20 released in November 2, 2023

[**VLC Media Player**](https://www.videolan.org/) can do much more than play videos. One extra function is to free convert DVDs to MP4, WebM, MPEG4, AVI, TS, OGG, WMV, etc. There are some basic options to adjust the video bit rate, audio quality, and audio channels. VLC is not the preferred free DVD to MP4 converter as users can't get much control over the output quality they want to get, but hopefully, it can help someone out in a pinch. 

**Note:** VLC doesn't support DVD copy protections except CSS. But here is a workaround: as VLC has libdvdcss built-in, you can play the protected disc with VLC, remember the correct title, and tell VLC which title to rip when converting. However, this method doesn't work with all protections. 

Pros:

Easy and popular. 

No watermark.

Customize video/audio settings, like codec and bit rate. 

Cons:

VLC is not a professional DVD ripper. Only able to convert homemade and CSS DVDs to MP4 on Mac.

**How long does VLC take to convert DVD to MP4?**

It will take the entire runtime of the movie to convert it because VLC is "streaming" the movie to a file on your hard drive.

**How to fix "VLC converts DVD to MP4 without sound"?**

This is a common problem. You may fix it by choosing the MPEG 4 audio (AAC) option instead of the default mpeg audio and changing the sample rate to 48000.

brew install ffmpeg

Now FFmpeg is installed on your Mac. Let's continue to convert a DVD to MP4 with it: 

**Step 2.** To rip a DVD with FFmpeg, you just need the \*.VOB files in the VIDEO\_TS folder. Below is the command line to convert a DVD to an mpeg4+mp3 MP4 on Mac. 

ffmpeg -i - -s 720x576 -c:v mpeg4 -c:a mp3 -qmin 1 -qmax 3 -b:a 256k -b:v 4000k -y encoded.mp4

**Step 3\.** If there are several VOB files in the DVD and you'd like to convert them into a single MP4 video, you will need to combine them into one VOB first:

cat VTS_01_1.VOB VTS_01_2.VOB VTS_01_3.VOB VTS_01_4.VOB > temp.VOB

[**MakeMKV**](https://www.makemkv.com/) is not an exact free DVD to MP4 converter for Mac, as it only supports MKV as the output format.

Pros:

Free. No watermark.

Support protected DVDs & Blu-rays.

Allow preserving all video and audio tracks.

Original quality reserved. Lossless 1:1 copy.

Cons:

Rip DVDs to MKV instead of MP4\. You need to convert MKV to MP4 using extra tools like Handbrake.

##  FAQs about Converting DVD to MP4 on Mac 

### 1\. Can I convert a DVD to MP4 on Mac using QuickTime?

No. In QuickTime, you can import a video, then choose File > Save As, and convert the video to MP4 H.264 or HEVC. It will be the perfect program if it's able to convert DVDs into MP4\. Unfortunately, while QuickTime supports various different video formats, it doesn't accept DVDs or DVD media. As a result, you can't use QuickTime to convert a DVD to MP4\. 

### 2\. How long does it take to rip a DVD to MP4? 

The DVD to MP4 converting speed on Mac is influenced by a set of factors such as the DVD ripper, the MP4 quality, and the computer configuration, etc. On the same hardware, you can select a DVD converter that supports GPU hardware acceleration to achieve a faster speed. Among the above free DVD to MP4 converters for Mac, the two programs that support hardware encoding are:

* MacX DVD Ripper Free
* HandBrake

During our testing, MacX DVD Ripper took just 5.8 minutes to convert a 2-hour DVD to MP4 H.264 format, while HandBrake took 20 minutes.

### 3\. How to convert a DVD to MP4 on a Mac without disc drive? 

An optical drive and a big hard drive are a must for DVD ripping. If your Mac doesn't contain an internal disc drive, get an external DVD drive like Apple's USB SuperDrive. Here is a [list of external disc drive for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) \>> 

### 4\. Any other DVDs to MP4 converters for Mac? 

In addition to free DVD to MP4 rippers, there are many paid programs with more powerful performance.

But in Australia, Spain, and many other areas, users are allowed to copy a commercial DVD for personal use. With that being said, you won't be caught or sued for converting a protected DVD for private use. Unless you distribute the copies, no one will ever know.

### 6\. Can iTunes convert DVD to MP4?

No, iTunes itself cannot convert a DVD to MP4\. However, you can use third-party software to rip the DVD and then import the resulting MP4 file into iTunes.

### 7\. How to convert DVD to MP4 using Format Factory?

Step 1\. Download and install Format Factory on your computer.

Step 2\. Open Format Factory and access to DVD to Video File tool.

### 8\. How can I convert DVD to MP4 fast?

If you're looking to rip a DVD to MP4 quickly, consider using a GPU-accelerated DVD ripper such as MacX DVD Ripper, HandBrake, or WinX DVD Ripper. These programs utilize your computer's graphics processing unit (GPU) to speed up the conversion process. If you're working with an older or less powerful computer, MacX DVD Ripper is still a good option because it supports using multi-core CPUs and hyper-threading technology to speed up DVD conversion.

### 9\. Is there a free DVD to MP4 converter without watermark?

Yes, there are several free DVD to MP4 converters that won't add watermarks to your output. Some of the options include MacX DVD Ripper Free Edition, HandBrake, VLC, and FFmpeg.

### 10\. How do I convert a copy-protected DVD to MP4 on a Mac?

To convert a copy-protected DVD to MP4 on a Mac, you can try using programs such as MacX DVD Ripper Free Edition (which supports all DVD copy protections), VLC (which only works with CSS-protected DVDs), DVDFab DVD Ripper (although the free trial doesn't work with the latest encryptions), or WinX DVD Ripper for Mac (which supports all DVD copy protections).
