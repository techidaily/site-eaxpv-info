The **video thumbnails** you use for YouTube are vital to getting views and subscribers. There are a lot of things that go into making people watch your videos, but your video thumbnail might be the most important factor.

Here are 5 easy tips for creating thumbnails that get views.

1. **[Have a Consistent Layout](#one)**
2. **[Use Your Face](#two)**
3. **[Use Graphics/Emojis That is On Topic](#three)**
4. **[Make Your Text Huge](#four)**
5. **[Keep It Clutter-Free!](#five)**

## Edit Your Videos Before Creating Video Thumbnails

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## 1\. Have a Consistent Layout

Your thumbnails all must look like part of the same set. You want viewers to recognize your videos like yours, and they are more likely to do that if you build up a standard layout that they can start associating with you.

An example of a standard layout could be you in the middle of the screen wearing an expression that matches the theme of your video, with your title written underneath your face. Every individual thumbnail would still be different, but you and the text would always be in the same spot.

![Consistent Layout](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/consistent-layout.jpg)

## **2\. Use Your Face**

People feel automatically connected and drawn into images that make eye contact. This makes thumbnails which feature faces more click-able than thumbnails which don’t, in most genres (i.e. if you make food videos then this may not apply – featuring the food might be more important than featuring your face). [Check out more tips like this here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Also, if somebody recognizes you in your thumbnail from a previous video of yours, that will go a long way towards making them click.

## 3\. Use Graphics/Emojis that are On Topic

Anybody can take a screenshot of themselves in their video and use it as a thumbnail. To make your thumbnails look polished, consider using small images (like emojis or hearts) to stand out. This will add color and personality to your thumbnail.

Make sure the images you choose are relevant to the topic of your video.

## 4\. Make Your Text Huge

If you use text in your thumbnail (you don’t have to) then it should be to add context. For example, if the main image is just you smiling then you might need some text to let viewers know the video is a makeup tutorial.

Thumbnails might look large while you’re putting them together in your image editor, but when they’re displayed on YouTube they’re a lot smaller. That goes double if a viewer is watching on their phone. So, make sure that any text you use is large enough that it can be read easily on small screens.

## 5\. Keep it Clutter-Free

It’s great to add text and emojis to your thumbnails, but you do need to be careful not to add too much. You never want your thumbnails to look cluttered. Viewers should be able to glance at your thumbnails and know exactly what kind of video to expect – that’s difficult to do if there’s too much to process.

A good rule for text is to use only 1-3 words. That way they won’t clutter your screen, and you can make them large enough to read on small-screened devices.

 | ![Mirrorless Cameras 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirrorless-cameras-1.png) | Best daily mirrorless camera for vlogging: Canon EOS M50 The Canon EOS M50 is Canon's first mirrorless camera that comes equipped with both a fully-articulated screen and an external microphone jack. It came out only a few months ago and is already considered one of the best mirrorless cameras for vlogging. The M50 is also the only camera on our list that you can buy at a prosumer's budget that shoots 4K video. Yes, the Sony a7R III and Panasonic GH5S also shoot 4K video, but they are much more expensive. With Canon's new DIGIC 8 Image Processor, the camera's dual-pixel autofocusing system will perform even better.  **PROS** _\- Can shoot UHD 4K videos at 23.98 fps_ _\- Has a 2.36m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder_   **CONS** _\- No image stabilization_ _\- Battery life could be longer_                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| ![Mirrorless Cameras 4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirrorless-cameras-4.png) | Best entry-level mirrorless camera for vlogging: Canon EOS M100 The Canon EOS M100 is a small, but powerful mirrorless camera for vlogging. This camera can shoot full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. It cannot shoot 4K video, unfortunately. It uses its DIGIC 7 Image Processor and dual-pixel autofocusing system to ensure that your vlogs are always in focus. The M100 provides great ISO sensitivity options - it can reach up to ISO 25600. With its built-in Wi-Fi with NFC, you can transfer your media seamlessly to a computer.  **PROS** _\- Affordable_ _\- Great connectivity options_   **CONS** _\- Lacks advanced video recording features_ _\- No viewfinder_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ![Mirrorless Cameras 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirrorless-cameras-1.png) | Best mid-range mirrorless camera for vlogging: Canon EOS M50 The Canon EOS M50 wins this category as well in our books. It is the only camera on our list that shoots 4K video that is priced much lower than the Sony a7R III and the Panasonic GH7S. In case you missed it, check out my review on the [Canon EOS M50](#Best-daily-mirrorless-camera-for-vlogging).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ![Mirrorless Cameras 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirrorless-cameras-2.png) | Best professional mirrorless camera for vlogging: Panasonic Lumix DC-GH5S Originally, Panasonic had released it's GH5 as a hybrid camera that handles both photography and videography well. In response to hearing customers' interest in a more video-focused camera, Panasonic came up with the GH5S. In our list of the top mirrorless cameras, the Panasonic GH5S and the Sony a7R III are the two professional mirrorless cameras that can record 4K video. Between the two, though, the GH5S wins as the best professional mirrorless camera for vlogging because it sports a fully-articulated screen. Its micro four-thirds sensor is smaller than the a7R III's full-frame sensor. Even with a smaller sensor, though, the GH5S is made to still autofocus well in low lighting conditions. Another amazing feature is its ability to record 240 fps slow-motion video at full HD 1080p.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 204800_ _\- High video bit rates_   **CONS** _\- Expensive_ _\- The camera body weighs about 1.5 lbs_ |
