CPRM, shorthand of Content Protection for Recordable Media, may be unfamiliar to you at first mention, but actually you may know it very well in practical cases: 

_1\. I have a disc from Japan that I really want to be able to view. It was burned on a DVD apparently from a Sharp DVD Recorder. However, when I try to play it in VLC or any other program it is just green and pixellated._ \- Chopmeister 

2\. _I cannot copy the .VRO file from the disc to computer, when I try, I get a message 'Cannot copy VR\_MOVIE: Access is denied. Make sure the disk is not full or write-protected and that file is not currently in use.'_ \- Mattse

These issues are caused by the CPRM protection, namely DVDs are encrypted with a machine specific code, which means the [DVD](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) can only be played back on the original PVR/DVR and cannot be copied at random. In other words, only you get over the DVD-RW CPRM compatible problem with a superb [DVD CPRM decrypter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), can you remove and copy CPRM-protected DVD on Mac and Windows computers.

## Part 3: Something Else About CPRM

Having said all of the above, you may be still confused with CPRM. Here we'd like to give you a general comprehending about what's CPRM and why CPRM protected DVD cannot be played on non-CPRM DVD players.

### What is CPRM?

Content Protection for Recordable Media (CPRM) is a mechanism for controlling the copying, moving and deletion of digital media on a host device, such as a personal computer, or other digital player. It's already used in specific removable media, and is now being proposed for inclusion in the ATA specification, for hard drives and recordable DVD discs, including DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW, and DVD+RW discs. It is a form of digital rights management (DRM) developed by The 4C Entity, LLC (consisting of IBM, Intel, Matsushita and Toshiba).

### Why CPRM DVD Won't Play on Standalone DVD Players?

CPRM compliant means that the recorder will respond to the copy flag embedded in the incoming source by CGMS(Copy Generation Management System). When a CPRM-compliant recorder detects compatible media, it uses the unique Media ID on the disc to encrypt the data it records to the disc. The recorder will also write a block of data called the Media Key Block (MKB) which is used to decrypt the disc. 

If the disc is copied, the Media ID on the new disc will be different and the recorded data will not decrypt correctly. BTW, the CGMS can be divided into three types:

* Copy-Always: No content protection for DVD so that you can still record and copy such content as you want.
* Copy-Once: Some cable programs are broadcast with embedded "Copy Once" flag and can be recorded on either HDD, DVD-RAM or DVD-RW in VR mode, but not on DVD-R. In other words, you can record them with CPRM-compatible DVD recorders, but will be disabled to re-record or copy them.
* Copy-Never: most commercial DVD movies apply in "Copy Never" embedded in addition to Macrovision, and that's why standalone DVD recorders cannot copy commercial DVDs.
