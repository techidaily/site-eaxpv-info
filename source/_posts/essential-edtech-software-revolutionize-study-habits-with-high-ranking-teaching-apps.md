Bonus Tip

eBooks or audiobooks purchased through Kindle, Audible and VitalSource platform are protected by DRM, which means that those purchased content can only be accessed via specific apps and devices under your authorization. Thus, DRM has caused a lot of inconvenience for the customers. For example, the biggest problem is that you can not even back up your purchased content. Fortunately for you, if you have the same concerns as I do, there are 3 DRM Removal that can help you decrypt ebooks, audiobooks and e-textbooks purchased via Kindle/Google Play/Nook/Kobo/Audible/VitalSource, etc. These 3 terrific DRM Removal are Epubor Ultimate, Epubor Audible Converter and Epubor VitalSource respectively.
