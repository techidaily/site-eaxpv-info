Whether you are new to YouTube or have been vlogging for a while you probably want more views. Having entertaining and/or informative content is the most important thing, but making great videos can only get you so far if people never get a chance to watch them. There are strategies you can use to make sure people get a chance to watch your videos in the first place.

In this article, we will let you know how to get more views on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com).

## 10 Tips for Getting More Views on YouTube

### 1\. Be Searchable

A big part of how to get views on YouTube is making sure people get a chance to watch your videos. People cannot click on something that does not come up in their search results. If you want people to get the chance to see your vlog you need to tailor the titles, descriptions, and tags of your videos so that they come up in searches.

A good way to start is to do a search for your topic and check out how videos that come up first are tagged. This will give you a sense for what keywords you should try to incorporate. For a more in-depth explanation of how you can use your titles, descriptions, and tags to get more views read ‘How To Upload Videos to YouTube’ and watch Tasha’s video.

### 2\. Link Yourself

If somebody is watching your video and enjoying it then they will probably welcome the chance to check out similar content. At the end of your videos always include a link to one of your previous videos. If somebody has watched your video all the way through then they must have liked it, and there is a good chance they will click your link. You can use either YouTube Cards or annotations to redirect viewers to your other videos.

You do not have to limit yourself to providing links only at the ends of your videos, but you should never include more than three total links in one video. If there are too many then people will start ignoring them.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![link yourself](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-views02.jpg)

### 3\. Make Playlists

Playlists work for the same reason that linking to your other videos does. If somebody likes what they are watching they will probably like watching something similar. The great thing about playlists is that the viewer does not have to take action and click on another of your videos – one just automatically plays when their current video ends. People watching a video on a playlist are more likely to watch multiple videos from that playlist.

If one of your videos is ranked high on a YouTube search, and that video is also on a playlist, then your playlist will also come up in that same search. This will put your other videos in the path of potential viewers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. Ask and You Shall Receive

If you can get more people to subscribe to your videos then you will see your view counts start to snowball. How do you get people to subscribe and share your videos? Ask them to.

People are more likely to subscribe or share if they are prompted to, so make sure to remind viewers to subscribe and share in every video. Consider putting a ‘subscribe’ button at the end of every video.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 5\. Use YouTube Cards

The overlays that show up in the videos are the YouTube cards. In the overlays, you may add any link, call-to-action-button, image or a title that can explain the content of your video or help in sales.

For instance, when you create a video series, YouTube card helps your viewers to get to the webpage directly when you mention the link on the card or find and watch the following video in the sequence easily.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 6\. End Screens Is Useful

The YouTube end screens are one of the best ways to get YouTube views. It offers several options to your viewers through the Call-to-Action button when you create your brand. You may consider inviting your audiences to subscribe and suggest a few videos that they may like from your channel.

The end screens appear at the last 20 seconds of your video and up to 4 elements can be added to each of it. You may also add your landing page’s link in the ens screen.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![end screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-end-screen.JPG)

### 7\. Optimize Thumbnail

In order to get more views on YouTube, the thumbnail image optimization can play a big role.

For instance, a celebrity or superhero image can prove to be beneficial when displayed in the suggested videos section, organic search results page or while you share on the social media.

It is highly recommended that only high-quality images must be used. The image must feature clear, comprehensible, and attractive fonts with facial-closeups.

But, you may use it only if they’re included in your video. The image thumbnail must relate to the description and title you used for the video to boost its value.

![thumbnail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/thumbnail.jpg)

### 8\. Provide Value

To get more views on YouTube, the content you offer must be valuable. It must either help people to learn something like how-to videos or keep people entertained and engaged. When you offer valuable content, people get back to you for more and also help in increasing views in your future videos.

### 9\. Interact With Your Viewers

Without the viewers, it is not possible to get YouTube views so keeping your viewers in the loop is an ideal way to get more views on YouTube.

For instance, when a viewer leaves a comment on your video, it may be a positive or a negative one, try to respond in a much detailed manner without ignoring the comment. When you be a part of your viewer’s community and engage in their discussion, it shows you care for them and think about their success.

You may try to know if your content is helping them out and in return, they might remember your generosity and view more of your content in future. Do not be too pushy, just share your views or products and content.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 10\. Use Youtube Analytics Properly

To achieve success, it is essential to experiment, track the results, and make necessary changes as per requirement.

The YouTube Analytics helps to check the videos that performed best, the engagement of the viewers, and your audience’s demographics as well. With a detailed report, you can make necessary changes to your strategy that can help you to get more views on youtube.

## How to Post a YouTube Video on Instagram

Sharing YouTube videos to Instagram directly isn't possible yet, and for that reason, if you want to feature YouTube videos on your Instagram you'll have to go through a three-step process. However, this process is fairly simple, although some methods may be more complex than others and require you to spend a considerable amount of time on downloading and editing the files you want to share on your Instagram account.

* [Step 1: Download Videos from YouTube](#step1)
* [Step 2: Edit and Convert Your Files](#step2)
* [Step 3: Upload the Videos to Instagram](#step3)

### Step 1: Download Videos from YouTube

In order to post a YouTube video to Instagram, you have to download the video you want to share, adjust it to the platform's video requirements, and then finally upload it.

#### 1\. Downloading YouTube video to your PC

There are several different methods you can use to download a YouTube video to your computer, but using websites such as [ClipConverter](https://www.clipconverter.cc/), [Zamzar](https://www.zamzar.com/), or [OnlineVideoConverter](https://www.onlinevideoconverter.com/video-converter) that enable you to download and convert video files is probably one of the easiest and fastest ways to achieve your goal.

1. Choose one of the reliable online downloaders mentioned above and simply paste the video's URL into its input box.
2. Figure out which video format you'd like to convert the YouTube video and MP4 file extension is advised because it is most frequently used for Instagram videos.
3. The online converter will either enable you to download the files directly to a hard drive on your PC or to send the links of the converted video files to your email.

#### 2\. Downloading YouTube videos to a mobile device

**Download instructions for iPhones:** The process of downloading videos from YouTube with iPhones or iPads is not very simple because you'll have to go through several stages of the process before you can view the video file from your device.

1. After installing the [Documents 6](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/documents-by-readdle/id364901807?mt=8) app, launch the app and use its web browser, an icon that looks like a compass, to navigate to the [Savefrom.net](http://en.savefrom.net/1-how-to-download-youtube-video/).
2. You can copy the link of the YouTube video, by launching the YouTube app on your iPhone, accessing the Share option, and selecting the Copy Link feature. Alternatively, you can launch the Safari web browser on your device, play the YouTube video you'd like to download, and copy the URL of the video you'd like to download.
3. After you've copied the YouTube link, head back to the Documents 6 app and paste the link to the input box on the [Savefrom.net](http://en.savefrom.net/1-how-to-download-youtube-video/) window, you've already opened in the Documents 6 app. You'll be able to choose from several size options, like 1280p or 480p.
4. Select the file size that best suits the purpose for which you are going to use the video, and then proceed to tap on the Download option, and select Done to start downloading the YouTube video file.
5. Go to the Downloads menu in the Documents 6 app and locate the video you just downloaded. Tap and hold the file, and drag it upward until you spot the folder list. Access the Photos app from the folder list and place the file in the Camera Roll.

 **Download instructions for Android devices:**  YouTube video files are much easier to download from Android Smartphones since you can find a number of different apps that will enable you to download the files you want to share directly from YouTube.

However, Google, like Apple isn't too keen on apps that let you download YouTube videos freely, which is the reason why you'll have to spend some time looking for the right app.

If you have trouble finding the right app for the job on Google Play you can try getting [TubeMate](http://tubemate.net/) from the app's official website.

### Step 2: Edit and Convert the Files to Meet Instagram's Video Requirements

As you probably know the maximum duration of a video on Instagram is limited to one minute, which means that you'll probably have to cut the parts of a YouTube video you downloaded in order to be able to post it on your Instagram account.

This process will be much easier if you use a PC or Mac-based video editing software like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) because changing the video file extension or the duration of a video will be much quicker and simpler than if you opt to use some of the [video editing apps that are available for iPhones](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Android Smartphones.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

However, if you would still like to go through the process of editing the YouTube video you'd like to post on Instagram directly from the Smartphone you can use apps like [iMovie](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193?mt=8), [Videoshop,](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/videoshop-video-editor/id615563599?mt=8) or [Filmora](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wondershare.filmorago&hl=en) to change the duration of the video.

Altering the file extension of a video to commonly used mp4 files and the size of 1080 pixels X 566 pixels may prove to be a little more complicated than it would be with a PC or Mac-based video editing software.

### Step 3: Upload the video to Instagram

Here comes the final step of posting YouTube videos to Instagram. The file you want to post should be already placed on your Camera Roll, so you just need to launch the Instagram app from your Android phone or iPhone and click on the + icon located on the app's toolbar at the bottom of the screen.

Select the Library option, and tap on the video file you'd like to post to your Instagram account. Click on Next and proceed to add a description to your post as well as tags that will enable your video to reach a wider audience.

It is important to keep in mind that posting YouTube videos you don't have permission to use on your Instagram account is not advisable because copyright infringement is a serious offense that may result in severe penalties.

Being unique and producing the content specifically made for Instagram is a much better and much safer option at this point until Instagram decides to make sharing YouTube videos a simple process that requires you to just click on the Share button below the YouTube video you want to share to Instagram.

The video tutorial below shows you how to edit and export video clips for sharing on Instagram. Watch it and learn how to add extra filters and visual effects to make it more fantastic.
