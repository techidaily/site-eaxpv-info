 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Achieving a state of peace and tranquility isn’t always easy, in fact, a growing number of studies indicate that most people find it difficult to relax after a long day. The ensuing stress can cause insomnia, anxiety, depression, and a broad range of other psychological problems.

ASMR videos are a booming trend on YouTube as channels that post this type of content are attracting millions of followers. These videos contain audio and visual stimuli that can trigger the autonomous sensory meridian response that is characterized by the tingling which spreads from the top of the head downward.

So, in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best ASMR YouTube channels and help you discover the one that relaxes you the most.

## Part 1: The Best ASMR Sleep Channels

The staggering amount of ASMR content on YouTube makes finding the channels that offer videos that help the viewer fall asleep a difficult task. We’ve combed through YouTube in search of the best ASMR Sleep channels, so let's take a closer look at our selection.
