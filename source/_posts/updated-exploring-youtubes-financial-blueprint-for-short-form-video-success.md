## **Part 1\. YouTube Shorts Fund: Introduction and Benefits**

YouTube launched YouTube Shorts Funds in 2021 to financially support creators who produce engaging and popular Shorts content. The monetization scheme would distribute $100 million to high-performing creators on the platform. The creators would receive high engagement and views from their Shorts for funding.

![youtube shorts fund](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-youtube-shorts-fund-1.jpeg)

The main objective of the YouTube Shorts fund is to encourage creativity, diversity, and innovation in Shorts content creation. The fund operated between 2021 and 2022\. It lets creators earn $100 - $10,000 a month for their content.

![youtube shorts fund earnings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-youtube-shorts-fund-2.jpeg)

Participating in YouTube Shorts Funds offer several benefits to the creators:

* **Additional Exposure:** YouTube Shorts are predominately featured on the homepage, allowing creators to reach more people.
* **Recognition:** YouTube recognizes top Shorts creators through the Shorts Funding program, encouraging them to create more quality content.
* **Potential Earnings**: Creators can monetize their Shorts content in several ways including adding and other unique features.

YouTube incorporated monetization of Shorts in its YouTube Partner Program (YPP). Therefore, YouTube merged the Shorts Fund with the YPP in February 2023\. This led to YouTube Shorts Fund 2023 which now offers creators more opportunities to make money quickly on YouTube.

## **Part 2\. Making Money with YouTube Shorts: Eligibility and Earnings**

The new YouTube Shorts monetization policy means that content creators on YouTube with access to the YPP can also earn from Shorts. The revenue-sharing model has now taken the place of the YouTube Shorts Fund, which only rewarded creators using YouTube’s money. However, creators don’t have to be members of the YPP to start receiving YouTube Shorts funding. They only need to meet certain requirements, make unique content, and adhere to Community Guidelines.

### **How Much Can You Make with Short** **s**

The amount of money you can make on Shorts often varies. It can be hard to make decent money on Shorts sometimes, and other times it brings in a nice chunk of revenue. Unfortunately, the earnings are not as spectacular as the long YouTube videos. Most creators agree that the revenue per thousand views (RPM) for shorts is around $0.05 - $0.07\. This would translate to about $50 - $70 for a million Shorts views. Although the ad revenue is relatively lower, you can generate more revenue with the shopping features. This will depend on how wee you keep your audience active and engaged.
