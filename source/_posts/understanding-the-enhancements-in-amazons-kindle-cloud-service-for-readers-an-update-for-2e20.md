_**Kindle Cloud Reader**_ is familiar to those who often buy e-books at Amazon. Every time you select an e-book and choose a delivery method, you could see the "Deliver to someone's Kindle Cloud Reader" option. Generally we choose "Deliver to Kindle" so that we can directly read the book on our Kindle device. Some others may choose "Deliver to Kindle for PC" if they have installed Kindle for PC. For most people, these two methods are enough so that it seems like few people will notice the "Deliver to Kindle Cloud Reader" option. So what does the Kindle Cloud Reader do? Does it have some advantages? This article will tell you something about Kindle Cloud Reader and you'll get to know the charm of it.

### **What is Kindle Cloud Reader**

[Kindle Cloud Reader](https://read.amazon.com/) is a web app for online reading and library management. It's designed primarily for people who don't have Kindle device or don't want to install any extra software. Just choose "deliver to Kindle Cloud Reader" and then click "Read now in Kindle Cloud Reader" button, the splendid content will directly display in your browser.

### **2\. How to access Kindle Cloud Reader**

Every time you type in the URL: [read.amazon.com](https://read.amazon.com/), you'll get access to the Kindle Cloud Reader. Save this site as a bookmark so that you don't need to type the URL next time.

![kindle for the web safari](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kindle-for-the-web-safari.png)

 The Google Chrome also provides an extension. Search "cloud reader" in Chrome Web store and click "ADD TO CHROME". 

[_Kindle Cloud Reader on Chrome Web Store_](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kindle-cloud-reader/icdipabjmbhpdkjaihfjoikhjjeneebd) 

Then an icon will show at the top menu bar. You can click it to access Kindle Cloud Reader at any time.

### **3\. Supported Browsers**

![](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kindle-cloud-reader-compatible-browsers.jpg)

Even though Kindle Cloud Reader is a web app, it isn't like a common webpage that you can open it with any browsers. This is due to the fact that the Kindle Cloud Reader is based on HTML5, a new and strong web standard which some browsers don't support. At present Kindle Cloud Reader is available in Google Chrome, Apple Safari(both in Mac and iPad), Mozilla Firefox, IE.

| **Kindle Cloud Reader compatible browsers:**    |
| ----------------------------------------------- |
| Google Chrome: 20 and higher                    |
| Mozilla Firefox: 10 and higher                  |
| Safari: 5 and higher on Mac OS X/iOS 5 or newer |
| Internet Explorer 10                            |

As for reading experience, the Kindle for PC is not as brilliant as Calibre. It just provides some general settings such as font size, background color, line width, brightness. Although with simple functions, it do has some design of humanization like you can add notes and highlights and lookup words with its built-in dictionary which is very helpful in learning foreign language.

### **4\. Main features of Kindle Cloud Reader**

#### **1\. Online reading**

Kindle Cloud Reader provides an online reading mode in a browser. It can store content as much as 50MB. When the space is full, the older content will be deleted.

One thing must be pointed out is that the downloaded content is stored locally by browser, not bound with your account. That means if you change the browser or computer, the downloaded books will disappear. But all the books you bought and the bookmarks and notes will not lose as they are reserved at Amazon server.

![](https://www.epubor.com/images/faq.png) Frequently Asked Questions

##### Q: Where does Amazon Kindle Cloud Reader store those downloaded books?

Windows Chrome _C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\databases\\https\_read.amazon.com\_0_

Mac Chrome _\~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/databases/https\_read.amazon.com\_0_  
Can't find this folder on Mac computer? Open terminal, and then input _open "\~/Library/Application Support/Google/_ 
_Chrome/Default/databases"_ , Enter.

Safari _.../Users/Library/Safari/Databases/https\_read.amazon.com\_0_

Mac Firefox _/Users/Library/Application\\ Support/Firefox/Profiles/\*\*\*.default-release/storage/default/https+++read.amazon.com/idb/\*\*\*.sqlite_ 

![where is kindle kcr file](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/where-are-kcr-files.png)

#### **2\. Library management**

We can easily manage books by Kindle Cloud Reader. Like native Kindle App and Kindle for PC, the Kindle Cloud Reader supports three sorting orders (title, author, recent) and two display modes (grid and list). You can also adjust the cover size (not supports iPad).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
All your books are listed in the library. If your book is downloaded, there will be "Remove Book" when you right-click it. If you concern about the space (only 50MB), just right click or long press the book cover and choose "Remove Book" then the book will get deleted. This operation won't delete the book from your library actually, you can download it again.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
#### **3\. E-book customization**

Kindle Cloud Reader provides rich options for you to customize your reading. You can adjust font size, margins, color mode, or look up words, take notes and highlight text.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
#### **4\. Sync with your Kindle** (Notes & Highlights)

The sync feature makes us read seamlessly. Just click the sync icon and all your content such as new books, reading progress, bookmarks, will be refreshed. If you find that there is a delay when syncing, don't worry, just close the Kindle Cloud Reader and reload it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
I like this function most because I can copy the highlights without leaving the web browser. The highlight text is automatically added to my kindle account and I can reach in the web browser at <https://read.amazon.com/notebook>.

#### **5\. Optimized for iPad**

Amazon claims that the Kindle Cloud Reader can get a better experience on iPad. Besides some menu layout difference, this mainly refers to the Kindle Store. In PC browser, the Kindle Store of Kindle Cloud Reader links to a normal Amazon site. But on the Safari of iPad, the Kindle Store looks like a native app- UI elements are laid out in big, touchable areas and navigation is designed for the touchscreen user.

### How to backup Kindle Books?

Though we can read kindle books with Kindle Cloud Reader for online reading, we should always read our Kindle books by using a browser on computer. For a better reading on multiple devices, the best solution is to back up our Kindle books. The recommended tool is a new product from Epubor team, [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/), which provides you with a rather easy way to remove Kindle DRM and convert Kindle books to PDF/Epub/Mobi/Azw3.

Then you need to download your purchased kindle books via kindle for pc 1.23 and then remove drm and convert them to epub or mobi format so that you can read them on any device or apps. For details, please read <https://www.epubor.com/how-to-remove-drm-from-kindle-kfx-ebooks.html>

I cannot open cloud reader. I just get a black screen. I had this problem in October and spoke with someone and they could not figure it out. Whatever the problem was, it fixed itself. Now it is happening again. All but one of my books show the cloud reader device. On a current book selected the cloud reader device is not highlighted. I started having problems on May 19, 2021\. I am using an Apple iPad. Thank you.
