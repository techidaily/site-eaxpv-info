### FAQs About YouTube Shorts

1. **Where to download the YouTube Shorts app?**

The **YouTube Shorts app** is already present in the YouTube app that your Android or iOS smartphone has. All you need to do to access it is, sign in to your Google account, tap the **+** button at the bottom, and tap **Create a Short** in the popup box that comes up.

1. **What if YouTube Shorts is not showing on my YouTube app?**

Make sure that your YouTube app is updated to its latest version. If the app is already updated, and **YouTube Shorts** is still unavailable, the chances are that Google hasn’t rolled the app in your region. Since **YouTube Shorts** is still in its Beta phase, only the region of India can use all the functions of the app at the time of this writing. In such a case, you are suggested to wait until the **YouTube Shorts app** is made available for your location.

1. **What’s the YouTube Shorts video duration?**

A **YouTube Shorts** video can be of only up to 60 seconds.

1. **What’s the YouTube Shorts size limitation?**

YouTube hasn’t provided any information related to this as of now. However, you can rest assure that a 60 seconds long video file wouldn’t be too large for YouTube to handle.

1. **How many subs do you need to access Shorts?**

**YouTube Shorts** is available for everyone regardless of the number of subscribers the channel has.

1. **Can you make money on Shorts?**

Unfortunately, NO. Although you cannot monetize the recordings published as **YouTube Shorts**, they can be a good source to drive subscribers to your main YouTube channel that may have the videos that can be monetized.
