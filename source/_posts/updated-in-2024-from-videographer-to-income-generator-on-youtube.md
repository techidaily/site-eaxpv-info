## Part 1: When does youtube pay you \[threshold to meet\]

As a YouTuber, do you feel like you're always struggling to reach some "threshold" where YouTube finally starts rewarding your efforts with some financial reward? You came to the right place; here's a list of Youtube minimum criteria to reach the threshold.

### 1\. 1K subscribers

The first requirement to monetize your channel is to increase your subscribers to at least 1000.

### 2\. Follow all the YouTube channel monetization policies

These policies are a collection of documents containing all the policies, guidelines, and terms that apply to the YouTube Partner Program and advertising programs.

### 3\. Availability in your region

It would be best if you were in the listed countries where Youtube Partner Program is available.

### 4\. Strike free channel

Remember to avoid any strikes if you are planning to monetize your channel.

### 5\. 4,000 watch hours

To qualify as a creator with a sustainable audience, you'll need at least 4,000 public watch hours within 12 months in your channel.

### 6\. AdSense account

You'll need to ensure that you have a Google Adsense account set up and ready to go. Without an Adsense account, the video isn't eligible to be monetized.

## Part 2: How Do You Get Paid on YouTube?

We know that making money from YouTube can be challenging but not impossible. We'll help you figure out how to get paid. Whether you want to create your videos and monetize them or you want to take advantage of the huge pool of talent. We'll show you what the impact of the Youtube Partner program is on the revenue of YouTube channel owners:

### Video length

One of the most noteworthy characteristics of a YouTube video is its length. A longer video provides a greater amount of information, which means a greater likelihood of the viewer actually watching it to completion.

### Ad Quality

The two main qualities that differentiate high-quality YouTube ads are relevance and timeliness. It would be best if you tailored the ad to what's happening within the video to be relevant. For instance, an ad about a new study may be relevant if the video is about health or science. The ad should also be timely. If you're looking to get more revenue out of your channel, the quality of your ads should be high.

### Number of clicks each ad receives

The number of times your video ad is shown is an important factor in how much it makes. You can increase your ads' revenue potential by increasing the ad's number of clicks. Advertisers use this metric to gauge the effectiveness of their campaigns, which is why optimizing the number of clicks your ads get is so important.

### Ad Blockers

And there are two problems with ad blocking. The first is that it cuts off revenue. The second problem is that it reduces user engagement. Ad blocking decreases the amount of time that users spend watching videos. Youtube videos that rely on advertising to generate revenue may decrease their income.

### Bonus: See how much you can get by YouTube Pay Calculator

## Part 4: Alternative ways to earn more money from YouTube

Some people think they can't make money from YouTube...but that's not true. You can make good money from YouTube, even as a newbie. It just takes some persistence and hard work to make that happen. We'll show you some alternative ways to make more money on YouTube.

### Make Good Content Continuously

Making good content that people love to watch repeatedly is a great way to earn more money. The key is improving the content continuously every week, month, or year.

Creating content that is both entertaining and informative helps people to make decisions. An audience can get a lot of information from the video, but if it is not of good quality, it will not have a good impression.

### Bonus: Spice up your videos with [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

A powerful video editing software can help you a lot. With an impactful editor software like Filmora, it allows you to add titles, music, and transition effects to give your video more visual appeal.

Even the most inexperienced user can create a compelling, professional-looking video with Filmora in minutes. With Filmora's video creation tools, anyone can easily edit, add effects, change text, and even make voiceovers. Filmora's intuitive interface is a dream for non-experts as well. Some of its unique features include:

### Green Screen

The green screen doesn't just change your background but creates special effects, too.

### Keyframing

It helps your videos look more energetic with smooth animation.

#### Color Correction

Add or make your own stunning 3D LUTs with color correction.

### Join Affiliate

Affiliate marketing is a relatively easy way to turn YouTube viewers into customers. You can join many successful affiliate programs, but if you're looking for the most money, go for the ones that offer a recurring commission.

### Get Brand sponsorships

If you're wondering if getting brand sponsorships for Youtube is worth the money, the answer is a resounding yes. Sponsorships on Youtube generate tons of views and even more engagement than ads do.

But brands tend to sponsor only content deemed relevant to the brand. So if you want to be a sponsored content creator, you must get to know your audience first and then build out your social media strategy around the products you sell and the messages you want to communicate.

## Hot FAQs on YouTube channel monetization

### 1\. What if I don't meet the program threshold?

While trying to meet the threshold, focus on making content that will stand out from the competition and build your channel.

### 2\. If I meet the threshold, do I automatically get into the YouTube Partner Program (YPP)?

No, the Youtube team will review every channel that passes the threshold. You cannot apply to join the YPP if your account has any active Community Guidelines strike. Plus, your channel must follow Youtube policies and guidelines.

### 3\. How much money does 1 million views make?

For every one million views a YouTube video gets, a YouTuber can make upwards of $5000, based on [Forbes's](https://mint.intuit.com/blog/relationships/how-much-do-youtubers-make/#:~:text=their%20videos.%20Using-,Forbes%E2%80%99s,-estimated%20pay%20rate) estimated pay rate of $5\. However, these are estimates, and the amount YouTubers earn from Youtube varies wildly.

## Final Words

This article is a pretty good overview of the "how" of YouTube monetization, though we would also add that it can take a while to build up a following on YouTube if you're starting. You'll want to ensure that you put enough time and effort into your videos.

Your content must be unique so your viewers will want to stick around and engage with you. And lastly, if you're looking to monetize your YouTube channel, focus on building your channel and growing your audience.

The main goal of every content creator is to increase its audience to expand its reach and views. To do so, it's essential to provide something unique and different to the viewer. Without providing them the content they are looking for, it is impossible to grow your channel and reach. Once your content is ready and you are getting many views, it is essential to make these potential viewers your permanent viewers. The animated subscribe button will help you achieve this goal. While your viewers are watching your videos, you must remind them about subscribing to your channel for receiving such incredible content in the future. Subscribe animation plays a vital role in converting your viewers into subscribers.

There are so many platforms on the internet from where you can get Youtube subscribe button animation free, and you can also purchase these subscribe png gifs. But creating your own animated subscribe button can make you stand out from the crowd and make your videos unique and exclusive. Because it enables you to design it the way you want according to your brand, so, let's create your own subscribe animation using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Step-By-Step guide

**Step 1:** To get started,open Filmora X. On your upper left corner, click on the "Sample Colors," select the Green color and drag it to Video Track into the timeline. We are using a Green background to easily remove it using the green screen feature in Filmora to use it in our future projects after exporting it, without creating it again. Adjust the duration of this track according to your requirement. In my case, I am trying to make an animated subscribe button of 5 seconds.![subscribe-button1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button1.png)

**Step 2:** Lock this track by clicking on the lock icon to work on subscribe animation without disturbing the background easily.![subscribe-button2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button2.png)

**Step 3:** Now it's time to design the subscribe png gif. Go to the Sample colors again and drag the red color into the time above the green background.![subscribe-button3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button3.png)

**Step 4:** Double click on the red color in the timeline and adjust its size. Make it look like a subscribe button that is a rectangle and place it at the bottom center of the background. You can put it anywhere you want it to appear in your future videos.![subscribe-button4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button4.png)

**Step 5:** Now, let's add Subscribe text into the button. Go to the Title and select any style that you like. "Basic 6" will work perfectly fine for this purpose. Drag and drop it into the timeline above all tracks.![subscribe-button5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button5.png)

**Step 6:** Double click on the Title on the timeline and edit it with "Subscribe" and place it under the red rectangle and click OK.![subscribe-button6](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button6.png)

**Step 7:** We have put a cursor that can click on the animated subscribe button. You can use Google Search to find a transparent cursor. Make sure to save it in png format. Download it and import it into Filmora.![subscribe-button7](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button7.png)

**Step 8:** Drag and drop the cursor into the timeline and place it above all the other three tracks to make it prominent. Adjust the size of the cursor place it on the Subscribe button where you want it to appear.![subscribe-button8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button8.png)

**Step 9:** Now, it's time to animate the design using keyframes. First of all, let's animate the red rectangle. Double click on the red color on the timeline. Go to the 'Animation' tab and then click 'Customize.' Move to the 1 second in the timeline and click 'Add.'![subscribe-button9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button9.png)

**Step 10:** Now go back to the beginning in the timeline and adjust the scale to 0%. It will make the rectangle pop up when you play the clip.![subscribe-button10](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button10.png)

**Step 11:** Text needs to be animated as well to match it with the rectangle. Double click on the text in the timeline and click 'ADVANCED.'![subscribe-button11](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button11.png)

**Step 12:** In this Advance text editor, go to the 'Animation' tab and select any animation that you like. On the timeline under the preview screen, adjusts the dark areas according to the time you set on the rectangle, which was 1 second. We want the text to appear on the screen in 1 second, like the rectangle. Also, adjust the ending time when you want the text to disappear again. We have set it on 4 seconds. Which means it will start to fade after 4 seconds.![subscribe-button12](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button12.png)

**Step 13:** Now, to animate the mouse cursor, we will use the same process we used for a rectangle that is key framing. Double click on the cursor track on the timeline and move the time on your timeline to a point when you want the cursor to appear. Now add a key frame by clicking 'Add'.![subscribe-button13](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button13.png)

**Step 14:** Now jump back to a point in your timeline, when the cursor will start appearing from outside the screen. Move the cursor outside the screen from where you want it to start moving toward the subscribe animation.![subscribe-button14](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button14.png)

**Step 15:** To animate the click of the cursor, move ahead a little bit into your timeline and scale down the cursor to around 70%. Move it a little further and scale it up to 100%.![subscribe-button15](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button15.png)

**Step 16:** You can add the sound of mouse click to make it more realistic. You can find this sound anywhere on the internet. Download it and import it into Filmora. Now place it into the timeline where it can match the movement of the cursor.![subscribe-button16](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button16.png)

**Step 17:** Now it's time to make this subscribe animation button disappear. Move forward into the time to the end, at around 4 seconds. Double click on the red button in the timeline and add a key frame at its actual scale.![subscribe-button17](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button17.png)

**Step 18:** After that, move further in the timeline to the end and make its scale 0\. It will make it disappear.![subscribe-button18](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button18.png)

**Step 19:** Do the same with the cursor. Double click on the cursor in the time and add a key frame at its actual position.![subscribe-button19](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button19.png)

**Step 20:** Move ahead when you want it to disappear. Move the cursor out of the screen and click 'OK'.![subscribe-button20](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button20.png)

**Step 21:** Your Subscribe png gif is ready to be exported and used in your videos. Click on export and choose from various formats and options to choose from while exporting it.![subscribe-button21](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button21.png)
