_Clicked the Share button, selected "File", and iMovie saved my movie in the appropriate location, in .mp4 format. But I tried to open the movie in QuickTime and QuickTime gives me a "converting" message and bar for a moment, and then the error message, "QuickTime player can't open moviename.mp4 To see if additional software is available that will enable QuickTime Player to open the movie, click Tell Me More.”_ 

_I exported a movie that I made using iMovie and the file it produced was an mp4, but when I double click the file to play it, it says “The file isn't compatible with QuickTime Player"._

Apple's own software QuickTime Player should have no problem playing the exported files from iMovie. Why it won't open the iMovie project saying the file is not compatible with QuickTime, even for MP4 exports? In this post, we're going to talk about why and what to do when your QuickTime can't open iMovie files.

## \[Quick Fix\] Convert iMovie Incompatible Video for QuickTime 

[**MacX Video Converter**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) \[free & safe\] will help if your iMovie export video is not compatible with QuickTime: 

* **Convert iMovie output files to QuickTime formats** like MOV, QT, MP4, H.264, HEVC, 3GP, and **350+** preset profiles for QuickTime, iPhone, iPad, Android, iMovie, iTunes, Apple TV, etc.
* Convert 4K, 1080P, and 720P MOV/MP4 iMovie videos to QuickTime formats **without quality loss**.
* **5x faster speed** \- Support Intel QSV/Nvidia/AMD/M1 (Pro/Max/Ultra) hardware to speed up the iMovie videos to QuickTime conversion process.

## What to do when iMovie file is not compatible with QuickTime? 

* [1\. Export the movie with the Best quality](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)
* [2\. Check if there are temporary files](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)
* [3\. Convert the file to MP4/AAC](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)
* [4\. Delete the iMovie preferences](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)
* [5\. The iMovie video is corrupted](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)
* [6\. Check the output folder](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)

##  1\. Export the movie with the Best quality

If the iMovie MP4 output is not compatible with QuickTime Player, you can save your movie project in another format. When you export the movie from iMovie, select Best (ProRes) under Quality in the share dialogue box. That will save your iMovie project in MOV instead of MP4 (exports at all other quality settings will generate a smaller .Mp4 file.). Then you should be able to open the iMovie MOV file in QuickTime Player without problems. Note that the file size of the MOV file will be larger than MP4, but the quality will also be better.

Tips: If the MOV file is too big for you, you can re-encode it into a smaller MP4 using Handbrake or other free video converters. 

![imovie mp4 not compatible with quicktime](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/imovie-best-quality.jpg) 

## 2\. Check if there are temporary files

Check the final video and make sure the iMovie export is complete. Are there any temporary files next to your final movie? Temporary files mean that your movie is still in the rendering process. After you export the iMovie project, its name will show in Finder immediately. But the video is still processing. And the final MP4 movie may come with a file size of zero bytes before the rendering completes. If you try to open the MP4 file, it will say the iMovie file is incompatible with QuickTime. You can:

* Check if your hard drive has enough space to let iMovie store the export video.
* Check if there is any corruption on the project that causes [iMovie export errors](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).
* Copy/paste your media and re-edit it in a new project.

## 3\. Convert the file to MP4/AAC

If the QuickTime still can’t open an iMovie file, you can try to convert it into Mpeg-4/AAC with H.264 codec, even if it's already in MP4 format. This is to fix the "iMovie export not compatible with QuickTime" errors caused by format/codec issues. You can convert the iMovie export file using free tools like Handbrake, VLC, and MacX Video Converter. Here we take [MacX Video Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) to show you how:

[Free download the converter here](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). Then open the app and click the "Add Video" button to load the iMovie video. It accepts all iMovie exported files in 4K, 1080P, 720P, etc. 

Once the video is loaded, a screen will pop up to let you select the output format. Go to the General Profiles > select to encode to Mp4 with H.264\. Click Run to let it re-encode. Then try if QuickTime can open it. 

**Tips**: If the iMovie video can’t be imported to a video converter, showing an invalid source, it indicates that the file is fatally corrupted. In this case, you need to create a new library, transfer your project into it, and then re-sharing the project. Or better yet, recreate the project and share it. 

## 4\. Delete the iMovie preferences

Corrupted iMovie preferences may cause your iMovie project to become corrupted. And therefore, the QuickTime Player can’t open the iMovie exported MP4, MOV. You’re suggested to delete the iMovie preferences. Deleting the iMovie preferences won’t always work. But it’s the easiest thing to do before you take other more complicated measures. Below is how you can do it:

1. Launch iMovie while holding down the Option and Command keys.
2. Keep holding the keys until a panel pops up asking if you want to delete the preferences.
3. Click "Delete Preferences". After you deleted the preferences, you will need to enter all preferences again in the "iMovie > Preferences".

## 5\. The iMovie video is corrupted 

Try open the iMovie export video in another video player like VLC. If the iMovie export file is not compatible with QuickTime and VLC (or other player), and it's not recognized as a valid source by a video converter, then the file might be corrupted and unplayable. 

 In this case, go to iMovie > click Edit >Select All > and Copy to transfer your media to a newly created project. Then export the movie and see if QuickTimePlayer will play it. 

## 6\. Check the output folder 

Check where you store the iMovie export files. For example, if the iMovie project is stored on a volume with an incompatible file system format, QuickTime may not open the iMovie export video. If the iMovie files are stored on a volume that QuickTime does not have the necessary permissions, such as the volume used for Time Machine backups, you may also get the iMovie video could not be opened error in QuickTime.
