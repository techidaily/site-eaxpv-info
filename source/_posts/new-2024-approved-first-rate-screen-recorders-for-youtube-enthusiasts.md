The global pandemic has changed the way we live for the time being, and right now, we cannot attend events in the same way we did at the beginning of the year.

A growing number of cultural organizations, businesses, and influential YouTubers are turning towards YouTube’s Live feature because it provides a simple way of broadcasting different types of content in real-time. YouTube Live is by no means a new option, since the platform first introduced live streaming features in 2008, and some twelve years later, the feature has never been more popular.

However, the live streams you broadcast on YouTube are stored for just a brief period of time, which means you have to search for alternative methods of saving them. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the **best YouTube Live screen recorders** you can use to capture the video content you are sharing with your followers.

**Note:** We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos/audio materials from your own channel.

## Top 10+ YouTube Live Screen Recorders

The maximum resolution in which you can [record computer screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), audio recording options, or customization of the recording area are some of the most important features you need to consider while choosing a YouTube Live screen recorder.

We have selected some of the best YouTube Live screen recorders that enable you to do much more than just record live streams. So, let's take a look at what they have to offer.

### 1. OBS Studio

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows, Linux, macOS

The vast majority of live streams you can find on [Twitch](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and YouTube are made with OBS Studio, but besides broadcasting videos, the software also gives you access to screencasting tools. This means that you can specify the area of the screen you want to record, choose the recording’s resolution and frame rate, or adjust the audio recording options.

OBS Studio is the best free, open-source screen recording program you can download. You shouldn’t use a software just because it’s free, but OBS Studio is also an extremely versatile tool. You can both record and stream in high definition and it comes with the ability to record either through your webcam or through your screen. It records directly through the [graphics card](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which means it can capture games even when in full-screen mode whereas a lot of other screen-recording software forces you to play games in windowed mode. The high quality can be seen easily in whatever you choose to broadcast.

OBS Studio allows you to record videos from a variety of sources, which makes it a perfect option for capturing the content you share through YouTube Live since you can select a browser window you want to capture in just a few clicks. What’s more, this [open-source software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is equipped with basic video editing tools, which enables you to preview the video you recorded before publishing it, apply transitions between cuts, or perform basic color correction.

Check the detailed guide to [How to Record with OBS](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

### 2. XSplit

**Price:** $24.95 for a three-month license

All you need to do is define a workspace, then pick the preferred resolution and frame rate. The software allows you to capture screens in [4K resolution](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and at 60 fps, but it also offers a variety of resolution and frame rate options so that you can choose the one that best fits your needs. Furthermore, you can record the computer audio, which enables you to capture the live stream’s audio in excellent quality. Besides YouTube Live, XSplit can be used with [Zoom](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Skype, Google Hangouts, and numerous other live streaming and video calling apps.

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows

Flashback Express is a simple screen recorder that lets you create high-res videos effortlessly. Setting up a new screencasting session requires you to just specify the area of the screen you want to record, choose whether or not you want to record the webcam feed and hit the Record button.

There are no restrictions in terms of the duration of screen recordings you can make with Flashback Express and the software doesn’t watermark the video you create.

However, you can only save the files in MP4, AVI, or WMW formats and you cannot adjust the video’s frame rate or resolution. What’s more, editing videos or applying effects with Flashback Express isn’t possible and you must upgrade to FlashBack Pro if you want to edit the live streams you broadcast on YouTube.

This piece of software is user friendly, but it doesn’t have as many features as other products on the market.

You can only record the entire screen with VLC, since customizing the recording area isn’t an option, and all your files will be captured in the RAW format which means that you may have to resize them before you upload them to YouTube.

### 10. Screencast-o-matic

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $1.65 per month
