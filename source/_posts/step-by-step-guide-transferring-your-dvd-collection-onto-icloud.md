_"I'm trying to copy my wedding DVD to my iCloud drive so I can play it back using my phone as well as ensure it is saved on the cloud for future. Can anyone help with step by step instructions for someone that isn't too tech savvy."_ \-Apple Community

Then you can watch your movies on iPhone, iPad, and Mac without using the discs and an optical drive. However, you can't upload a DVD to iCloud directly. You need to convert DVDs to iCloud supported formats and then store the DVD movies on Apple iCloud. Below we will show you how to do it in details.
