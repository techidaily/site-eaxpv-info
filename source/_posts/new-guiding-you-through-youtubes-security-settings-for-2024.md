 Privacy settings on YouTube allow you to control who can see your videos. There are three settings — Public, unlisted, and private. This article will give you a brief introduction of what those three settings mean, and how to use them.

## Part 1: Public VS Unlisted VS Private

 Let's figure out some terms before runing into the how-to part.

 **Public Videos**

 These are videos that everyone can view. This is the majority of YouTube videos, and just about every one you’ve ever watched will have been public. You'll want this if you want lots of people to watch your video.

 **Unlisted**

 Unlisted videos are ones that anybody can view so long as they have the link. The video won’t show up on search results or in "related" or "suggested" videos.

 This is a great setting for sharing a video amongst small groups. You might have a rough edit you want to show a few people, or you might have a show reel that you only want certain people to see.

 **Private**

 Completely private videos cannot be watched by anyone who doesn’t have permission. You grant people permission by allowing their Google accounts to access the video. Nobody else can see the video, regardless of whether they have the link.

 It won’t show up on searches, as related or suggested videos, or even when imbedded in other sites. This is the best setting for a video you need to share with only very specific people, if anyone. Below is a comparison table to know more about [privacy settings](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en&oco=1).

## Part 2: How to Change Privacy Settings

 There are two ways to change the privacy settings: firstly, when you upload the video, and secondly through Creator Studio.

**Method 1:**

 When you upload a video to YouTube you'll see on the right hand side an option that says "privacy". This is defaulted to "public", but you can use the drop-down menu on the button to change the setting. This will apply your privacy setting the second the video finishes uploading and processing.

**Method 2:**

 To change the privacy setting later, go to Creator Studio, then Video Manager. On the right-hand side you’ll see one of three icons: a world, a chain, and a lock. The world means **"public"**, the chain means **"unlisted"**, and the lock is for **"private"**.

![youtube privacy settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unlisted-video.JPG)

 To change the privacy, click the icon. You’ll be taken to the video's info and settings page. Down below where you see the thumbnails you'll see the selected privacy setting. Click this to open a drop down menu, and select your desired privacy level.

## Part 3: Sharing Private Videos

 If a video is set to "private', you'll have the option to share it with specific people. Below where it says "private" on the info and settings page you'll see a button labeled "share". Click this and type in the email addresses of the people you want to be able to watch the video. You’ll also have the option of notifying the people via email that you’ve shared the video with them.

## Conclusion

 And that's all there is to it! Changing the privacy setting on YouTube videos is a simple, helpful tool to allow you to control the audience of you work. Enjoy!

## Dominance in Video Landscape: Mirrorless vs DSLR Cameras

# Mirrorless vs. DSLR Cameras: Which is Better for Videos?

If you’re looking to shoot your videos with interchangeable lenses, your camera set up will either have to have a mirrorless camera body or a DSLR camera body. In this post, I’ll be comparing the two camera body types for recording video.

* [Part 1: What is a DSLR Camera?](#part1)
* [Part 2: What is a Mirrorless Camera?](#part2)
* [Part 3: Mirrorless vs. DSLR - a Complete Comparison](#part3)

## What is a DSLR Camera?

![DSLR Camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dslr-camera.jpg)

DSLR cameras are digital single-lens reflex cameras. Like 35mm film cameras of the past, DSLR cameras are built with an angled mirror inside its camera body. This mirror allows you to look into your camera’s optical viewfinder and see exactly what your camera sees.

The mirror inside a DSLR camera flips up out of the way when you open the shutter to allow light to reach the camera’s image sensor.

## What is a Mirrorless Camera?

![Mirrorless Camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirrorless-camera.jpg)

Mirrorless cameras are interchangeable lens cameras without a mirror inside the camera body. With nothing to reflect your image, you won’t find any optical viewfinder to look through to see exactly what your camera sees.

Light passes through the lens of a mirrorless camera and lands directly onto the camera’s sensor.

## Mirrorless vs. DSLR - a Complete Comparison

#### Size and Weight

DSLR cameras are larger and heavier than mirrorless cameras because there are more parts that go into their camera bodies. DSLR cameras require enough space inside for an angled mirror to flip up out of the way.

If your video shooting style is more on-the-go, like that of a daily vlogger or travel vlogger, the smaller size and lighter weight of a mirrorless camera may be more suitable for you.

#### Previewing Images

When you’re using a DSLR camera, your optical viewfinder will show you exactly what your camera sees as opposed to a digital preview of what your image sensor picks up. No matter how bright or dark your scene actually is, through the optical viewfinder, you’ll be able to clearly see what your camera sees with the power of your eye.

Mirrorless cameras, on the other hand, display on your camera’s screen or electronic viewfinder a digital preview of what your camera is looking at. You will notice a lag, especially in low light, between actions that are taking place in front of the camera and the same actions being displayed in your live preview.

#### Lenses and Accessories

Having been around much longer, there are plenty more options for lenses and accessories when it comes to shooting with DSLR cameras. You can choose from all kinds of different quality levels and price ranges.

#### Video Resolution

4K video recording is more readily available in mirrorless cameras than DSLR cameras. At a much more affordable budget, you can get your hands on a 4K mirrorless camera. If you want to shoot 4K video on a DSLR camera, though, you will have to pay for some of the most expensive DSLR cameras on the market.

#### Image Stabilization

Up until quite recently, you needed to get the right lens with built-in optical image stabilization if you wanted to shoot stabilized photos and videos with an interchangeable lens camera. Image stabilization had not been readily available in the bodies of these cameras.

In recent years, however, mirrorless cameras have been much more active in their development of camera bodies equipped with shifting image sensors. Your shots can be even more stabilized when the optical image stabilization of your lens is combined with your camera’s in-body sensor-shift image stabilization.

#### Battery Life

When it comes to shooting video, DSLR cameras and mirrorless cameras consume about the same amount of power. It’s still safe to say, though, that DSLR cameras, for the most part, have better battery life than mirrorless cameras because their bigger batteries are packed with more power.

## Mirrorless vs. DSLR - Which One is Better for Video?

In my opinion, when it comes to filming a video, mirrorless cameras are the way to go. In such a short time, mirrorless cameras have made huge leaps in their capabilities. It won’t be long before the ultimate vlogging camera comes out on the mirrorless market.
