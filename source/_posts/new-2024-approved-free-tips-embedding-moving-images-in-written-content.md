It may be challenging to capture the attention of your audience if the video openings or PowerPoint presentations contain too much text. Striking a perfect balance between the visual and textual elements isn’t always easy, especially if the text is the only way to convey essential information to the audience.

Luckily, video editing and presentation software products offer the tools you will need to combine video and text. In this article, we are going to show you how to add a video to text in PowerPoint and Filmora.

## Part 1: How to Add Video to Text for Free with PowerPoint?

An effective PowerPoint presentation should contain proportionate amounts of textual and visual elements. Using too many images, videos or animations can make following a presentation difficult, just as too much text can render a presentation too static.

Adding videos to titles or subtitles you include in a slideshow you’re creating in PowerPoint can help you create a presentation that is both informative and visually entertaining. The process of combining videos with text in PowerPoint isn’t overly complicated, but you will still need to go through it several times in order to become familiar with it.

You should start by creating a new slide and adding a textbox to it. Proceed to type the word or phrase into the textbox and go on to format the text. Pick the font that matches the style of your presentation and make sure that the text size is large enough for the video to be visible.

Head over to the Insert tab, select Rectangle from the Shapes menu, and create a rectangular shape over the entire slide. Right-click on the slide and choose the Send to Back option from the menu. In this manner, you will position the rectangle you created behind the textbox.

![Add video to text - Powerpoint- insert shape](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/insert-rectangle-shape.jpg)

The next step you will have to take is to create the cut-out of the text within the rectangle. Select both the text and shape you placed in the background before clicking on the Format tab that is located near the end of PowerPoint’s ribbon.

Find the Insert Shape option and choose Subtract from the Merge Shapes drop-down menu. The shape of the text in the textbox will be applied to the object in the background, which enables you to add a video to that text.

![Add video to text - Powerpoint- substract](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subtract-from-merge-shapes.jpg)

Click on the Insert tab, and then choose the Video option from the Media menu. You can [insert a video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that is stored on a local hard drive or the Internet to PowerPoint. The video will cover the entire slide, so you must right-click on it and select the Send to Back option.

You can then fine-tune the video playback settings from the Playback tab. Preview the results before you move on to the next slide in your presentation, and make necessary adjustments if you don’t like how the video merged with the text.

## Part 2: Adding Video to Text in Filmora

Besides presentation software, you can also use video editing software products to add a video to text. Filmora lets you add a video to text in just a few simple steps. You can first make a text video with animation first, and then use the picture in picture feature to add the video to text. Here are the detailed information about how to add a video to text in Filmora.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

You should start by creating a new project in Filmora and importing the video you want to add to the text into the project. Click on the Titles tab, and choose the title that matches the visual style of your project.

![Add video to text - Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-title-effects.jpg)

Set the preferred duration of the title by dragging one of its ends to the left or right after you place it on the timeline, and then double-click on it to customize it. Click on the Advanced button once the Text tab opens and insert the text into the Input Text box.

![Add video to text - Filmora9 Advanced Editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-text-video-advanced-text-edit.jpg)

Proceed to select a font and adjust the text size before deciding if you want to [animate the text](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). When done, you should export the title as a video file, and then import it back into your project.

Now it’s time to add the text video and the background video to the project media library, and then place the two videos one above the other. Since we’re adding video to text, the text video should be placed above the background video.

![Add video to text - Filmora9 Compositing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/compositing-video-9.jpg)

Click on the video that contains text to gain access to the Video tab of the Editor panel and then expand the Compositing menu. Change the Blending Mode to Multiply, and the text in the overlaying video should be filled with the parts of the footage from the video below it.

Optionally you can enhance the colors in the background video or adjust the size of the text before exporting your project from Filmora.

**Conclusion**

There are so many different ways to create visually striking content, and adding videos to text is just one among numerous techniques that enable you to make a PowerPoint presentation or an opening of a video more interesting to watch.

Merging text with video is equally easy in PowerPoint and Filmora, so you just have to choose which software better suits your needs and select the materials that fit the style of your project. Learning how to add a video to text won’t take too much of your time, as this process can be completed in just a few quick steps. Which software are you using to add a video to text?
