### Key Takeaways

* Cyber kidnapping scams use deepfake audio and videos to convince victims that their loved ones have been kidnapped.
* New immigrants, seniors, parents, and those who overshare personal information online are at high risk.
* To protect yourself, establish a family safety code word, limit what you share online, share your location selectively, and stay calm if you receive a suspicious kidnapping call.

 You get a phone call, and a panicked, familiar voice pleads for help. They claim to have been kidnapped and demand that you pay a hefty ransom for their release. It's your worst nightmare come true—except that there's been no actual kidnap.

 You might have been a target of a cyber kidnapping call scam.

##  How Cyber Kidnapping Scam Works

 The cyber kidnapping scam is sinister and preys on a victim's love for their family. It starts with a phone call from a number you may recognize. On the other end is a disturbing voice claiming they've kidnapped your child or other family member. To punctuate their threats, they may use convincing [deepfake audio and videos](https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-can-we-bypass-gionee-f3-pro-frp-by-drfone-android/) that make it appear your loved one is being held captive.

 This is where things turn from bad to worse. The criminals will put your "frightened" child or family member on the phone, pleading for help. Images and videos sent to you seem to confirm they are bound in chains and under duress. Panicked, your instinct is to meet whatever demands necessary to secure their release. Ransom is always required through virtually untraceable wire transfers, cryptocurrency, or gift card payments. Once the money is sent, the criminals cut off all contact, leaving you frantically trying to locate your supposedly captive loved one, only to eventually discover the disturbing truth–your loved one was never in harm's way.

##  Who Is Most at Risk of Cyber Kidnap, and Why?

 When it comes to cyber kidnapping schemes, no one is entirely safe from falling victim. However, those most vulnerable tend to be new immigrants–especially international students studying abroad, as they are far from home. Just like the 17-year-old Chinese exchange student rescued in Utah on the Eve of 2024, naive international students can be convinced by crafty scammers to isolate themselves and fake pictures that they are being held captive. This convinces the overseas relatives to fork over tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to the schemers before realizing the truth.

 Next on the list are seniors. Unfortunately, scammers frequently target older individuals who may be more trusting of strangers and less tech-savvy overall. A convincing sob story about a grandchild in trouble paired with some fake photos can easily manipulate seniors into wiring huge sums of money. The elderly are also likely to have more savings built up over their lifetime, making them prime targets for criminals seeking a big payout. In addition to seniors, parents tend to also be at high risk of cyber kidnapping extortion. The schemes often involve a supposed child abduction, so worried moms and dads frantically trying to protect their kids can easily fall prey. In the same vein, affluent families, in general, should be on high alert for cyber extortion plots involving faked abductions, as criminals may come up with elaborate stories to squeeze out huge ransoms from them.

 Finally, people who overshare personal information online become prime victims. The more fraudsters know about you from your social media presence, the more ammunition they have to make a fake kidnapping scenario believable. Details about your family, friends, location, job, hobbies, and lifestyle can help criminals fabricate personalized threats.

##  How to Protect Yourself and Loved Ones from a Cyber Kidnapping Ransom Scam

 Cyber kidnapping ransom scams are becoming more common and sophisticated, but you can get off the radar of the perpetrators. Here are some tips to avoid being a victim of this call scam:

###  Set Up a Family Safety Code Word or Phrase

 Establish a secret code word only known to family members. If someone calls claiming to be a kidnapped relative, tell them to provide the code word or phrase. A real family member will know it; a scammer won't.

 For example, your family code word could be "Mayday" or "London Bridge is down"–something easy to remember but not obvious to an outsider. Explain to both children and adults that this should be strictly confidential, even if asked under pressing circumstances.

###  Give Silent Treatment to Unknown Callers

 When you answer calls from phone numbers you don't recognize, keep conversations with them short and tight-lipped. As we've established earlier, scammers often record calls to obtain voice samples, which can then be used with AI technology to imitate you in fraudulent schemes. So, the less audio they can gather from you, the better.

###  Outfit Check Before Your Loved Ones Walk Out

 Make a habit of mentally noting some basic details when your loved ones leave the house–what they were wearing, where they were headed, and when they planned to return. This can become invaluable information later for fact-checking if you receive any calls demanding ransom money for their alleged kidnapping.

##  What to Do If You Get a Suspicious Kidnapping Call

 The call comes out of nowhere. A gruff voice says they have your child and demand money for their safe return. Your instincts kick in. What should you do next?

 First, take a deep breath and try to remain calm. Easier said than done, but panic will only cloud your judgment. Try speaking slowly and clearly to buy time while assessing the situation. Ask yourself some key questions–does the voice sound familiar, or does it sound like it's using voice-altering technology? Does the number match your loved one's phone? Do they provide convincing proof or evidence that they have your loved one?

 Then, start asking questions–lots of them. Request to speak directly to your loved one. If they refuse, press them for unique details only your loved one would know as proof they actually have them. Listen closely for any red flags in their responses.

 While engaging with the potential kidnapper, try (or have someone close by) discreetly contact your supposed "kidnapped" loved one through another phone. Send them a text or give them a call. Hopefully, they'll see the message and confirm whether the threatening call is real or a scam.

 If you get your loved one on the phone, pay attention to their tone and responses. Do they sound distressed? Are they speaking freely or seem coached? Any sense that something is "off"? Err on the side of caution if you detect anything suspicious.

 Stall the threatening caller by repeating their demands as questions, asking them to clarify details, and telling them you need time to gather money. Every minute you keep them talking allows you to assess the situation and get help. Which brings us to the next step...

 Contact the authorities immediately. Regardless of whether you think the call is fake, alert local law enforcement. They have tools to track calls and equipment to determine if your family member is truly in danger. Don't delay getting them involved.

 It's a terrifying situation, but try to keep a level head. Avoid acting rashly until you've verified whether the threat is real (or not).

 These high-tech extortion scams prey on our deepest fears and vulnerabilities as human beings. Unfortunately, AI and video editing advancements seem to make these schemes more convincing and dangerous by the day.

 So if you ever get a suspicious kidnap call demanding ransom for a loved one, verify before you act, gather evidence, loop in the authorities, and try not to panic (easier said than done, we know).
