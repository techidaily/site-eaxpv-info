A Few Good Men

A good film for those who like court debate and military type stuff. Tom Crusie played a hotshot attorney named Kaffee who cares more about closing cases than seeking the real justice. He is asked to defend two marines who were accused of murdering. As the investigation continues, Kafee discards the aloofness with which he initially regards the case and determines to find out the truth.
