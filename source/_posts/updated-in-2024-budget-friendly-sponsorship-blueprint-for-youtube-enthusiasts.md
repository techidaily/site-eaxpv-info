The content you offer through your channel must offer valuable content. Not just that, you must have a library of valuable content so that the potential sponsors can browse through several materials in your channel. Uploading once in a blue moon or just a few contents in the beginning and expecting YouTube sponsorships to pour in is not the way out to acquire supporters.

### 3\. Leave Your Business Email

Always add a business email ID to your channel, which shows that you would love to receive business inquiries. This is the ID where you will receive notifications for friend requests, video comments, and even the battering messages once you have a large fan following.

### 2\. Reach Out Directly

Reaching out to the people directly is one of the tried and tested ways to acquire YouTube sponsorship for small channels. Research and try to find 50 to 100 companies that would be interested in your channel.

It will not be much difficult to search for that one person within this list whom you can connect with directly. Once you have the company’s list and detailed contact information of those companies, send a mail inviting them to check your channel and show your interest to partner with them.

It is essential to make yourself stand out in the colossal crowd. Ensure your channel is unique and somewhat different from the rest because the contacted companies keep receiving partnering submissions from several other content creators too.

One important thing is not to send out the same old letter to all 50 companies and keep hoping to receive a positive response from at least one. Try to focus on your channel’s USP and highlight the same in your letter to the companies while trying to contact the companies for YouTube Sponsorship.

## Part 3: Types of Sponsorship

#### 1\. Product Sponsorships

When you are searching for sponsorship for a particular product, ensure that it is relevant to your channel. Never approach the sponsors without ensuring the same as you might put off your viewers and your sponsors will not achieve their expected results. You might lose both your sponsors and audiences in such a case.

When you try to get YouTube sponsorship for small channels, it is quite difficult as the promotion of the product becomes limited to whatever small following they have. Product reviews and tutorials are the best ways to obtain product sponsorships.

### 2\. Paid Sponsorship

Among all sponsorships, paid sponsorship is the most challenging one. Usually, when you review the products of the affiliate links in your videos, you earn revenues, but, in the paid sponsorship you earn by advertising product and company links on your channel.

When you add the company’s products to your videos, you earn money. It appears at the beginning and at the end of your videos after it is played on your YouTube channel.

### 3\. Affiliate Sponsorship

It is the easiest of all sponsorships but also the least revenue-generating one too. Affiliate sponsorship works by sharing affiliate codes and links. It is used by your audiences to obtain discounts or offer you a reward.

There are two types in which affiliate sponsorship works. One is the discounting option where the code is shared and the viewers use these codes to get discounts anywhere between 5-15% in shopping products from that same site. Another option is to use the affiliate code to integrate it into an URL that offers profits to a content creator in form of traffic.
