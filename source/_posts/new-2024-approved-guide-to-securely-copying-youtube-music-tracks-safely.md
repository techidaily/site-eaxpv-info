## Essential Gear: Picking the Very Best Among Top 9 Free Logomakers

# Top 9 Free YouTube Logo Makers

Logos are a very important part of branding yourself, especially if youâ€™re an online business or personality, and that's why we've made this list of YouTube logo makers. When youâ€™re a part of a crowded platform like YouTube, having a logo definitely helps to differentiate yourself from all the other channels. In this article, weâ€™ll be going over the top nine resources online for making YouTube logos for free.

1. [PIXLR EDITOR](#pixlr)
2. [GETPAINT](#getpaint)
3. [CANVA](#canva)
4. [DESIGNEVO](#designevo)
5. [LOGOMAKR](#logomakr)
6. [FOTOR](#fotor)
7. [SNAPPA](#snappa)
8. [LOGASTER](#logaster)
9. [COOLTEXT](#cooltext)

## 1\. PIXLR EDITOR

PIXLR Editor is a powerful free online design tool that looks and feels a lot like PhotoShop. If youâ€™re going to design your YouTube Logo this way though, youâ€™re going to have to design it from scratch.

## 2\. GETPAINT

GETPAINT.NET is very much like PIXLR in that it looks and feels a lot like PhotoShop. But with GETPAINT.NET, youâ€™re going to have to download it and run it from your computer to be able to use it.

## 3\. CANVA

Unlike PIXLR and GETPAINT.NET, where youâ€™ll have to design your logo from scratch, Canva comes with a lot of customizable design elements, stock images, and filters you can choose from. Canva is a simpler design tool. You wonâ€™t be able to work with layers or add effects to your text.

## 4\. DESIGNEVO

Similar to Canva but even simpler and more focused on simple logo making is Designevo.

## 5\. LOGOMAKR

Logomakr is quite similar to Designevo but it allows you to work with layers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 6\. FOTOR

Fotor is similar to Canva. Although you get less premade text templates, you can at least add a drop shadow to your text.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1567905/13846" target="_top" id="1567905"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1567905" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1567905/13846" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 7\. SNAPPA

Snappa is also a great online tool similar to Canva and Fotor.

## 8\. LOGASTER

For those wanting an even simpler option, one that automatically designs several different options for you simply based on your brand name and activity that your brand is involved in, Logaster is a good tool for that. Logaster will supply with you many different design options. You might find one that you like.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 9\. COOLTEXT

Cooltext is a simple free website that gives you a library full of different text styles. You first choose the style that you want to customize and then replace the text. You can save your selection as a png and upload it into any of the other online design tools previously mentioned above.

If you want free templates that will work with a lot of these logo makers, check out our post on [YouTube Profile Picture Templates - Free Downloads!](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-profile-picture-templates-%E2%80%93-free-downloads%21-310.html)
