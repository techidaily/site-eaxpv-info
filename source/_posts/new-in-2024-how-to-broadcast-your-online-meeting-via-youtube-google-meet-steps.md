### 3\. Connect your YouTube Channel to Google Meet

## Unveiling the Art of YouTube Split-Screens

# How to Make a Creative Split-screen Video for YouTube?

##### Liza Brown

 Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions

If we talk about post-production techniques and visual effects, then [Split Screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) has to be one of the smartest picks. After all, it lets us narrate our story via two (or more) screens and gives our audience a superior viewing experience. Though, a lot of users find it hard to implement the split-screen effect on YouTube videos. Here, I will let you know how to come up with all kinds of YouTube split-screen videos by using a professional video editor.

## Part 1: The Diverse Applications of Split-screen Videos

Before we discuss how to work on YouTube split-screen videos, let’s quickly consider some major applications of this video effect.

* ### To draw a direct comparison

One of the most popular applications of split-screen videos is for comparing two or more instances or perspectives in the same frame. For example, you might wish to depict the lifestyle of two people from different parts of the world or simply compare the effect of various seasons in a single video.

![split screen video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-youtube-split-screen-video-1.jpg)

* ### To provide two or more perspectives

Videos are the best visual storytelling tools and just like any story, they can also have different perspectives. Ideally, the split-screen effect would be one of the best ways to show your audience all kinds of perspectives that can take place in your story.

One of the best examples was depicted in the movie “500 Days of Summer” in which we got several Expectations vs. Reality shots. These split-screen shots depicted the two major perspectives of the story in a single frame.

![split screen video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-youtube-split-screen-video-2.jpg)

* ### To implement the cloning effect

Have you ever wondered how filmmakers create a clone of a person in movies? To do that, we make the protagonist record both the scenes in front of the same background. Later, we implement a split-screen effect in which both the clips are combined in such a way that it makes the audience believe as if the scene has both, the character and their clone placed flawlessly.

### Step 1: Import the Videos You Want to Edit to Wondershare Filmora

Before you edit your YouTube split-screen video, you need to import clips to the application. To do this, just launch Wondershare Filmora on your system and click on the “Import” button to load your videos. You can also go to its **Menu > File > Import Media** to do the same.

### Step 2: Select the Split-screen Template and Add Your Videos

Great! Once you have loaded the interface of Filmora, you can locate a “Split Screen” section from the top. Just click on it to browse a wide range of split-screen video templates for YouTube to include two, three, or more clips. You can just double-click any template to get its preview and drag-and-drop it to the timeline to start working on it.

![filmora split screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filmora9-mac-apply-split-screen.jpg)

If you want, you can take the playhead and drag the pointer to adjust the length of the split-screen template on the timeline. To add your clips, just double-click on the split-screen template and click on the drop icon from the preview window. Now, click on the source clip to add it to the template and adjust its position to get the desired effects.

### Step 3: Edit Your YouTube Split-screen Video

Following the same drill, you can include multiple clips to the YouTube split-screen template. You can further go to its editing features and explore the “Video” tab to scale, reposition, or rotate your clips. There are also options to add borders in the split-screen effect to separate the clips distinctively in the video.

![filmora split screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/split-screen-video-editing-filmora9-mac.jpg)

Apart from that, you can also go to the “Color” section to access various color correction features. From here, you can adjust the brightness, temperature, saturation, tint, and other effects in the video.

![filmora split screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/split-screen-color-correction-filmora9-mac.jpg)

If you want to make your YouTube split-screen video more appealing, then go to the “Motion” feature. Here, you can easily implement any existing animated template for transitions and other effects.
