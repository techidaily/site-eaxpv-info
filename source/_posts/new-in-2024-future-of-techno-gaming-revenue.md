## Part 2: Techno Gamerz YouTube Earning and Stats

Ujjwal Chaurasia, alias Techno Gamerz, was born and grew up in New Delhi, India. The charismatic vlogger first joined YouTube on August 13, 2017, and uploaded his first gaming video on January 2018\. Initially, Ujjwal used his elder brother's phone to post gaming tutorial videos. This obviously limited his input on YouTube as he also had to set aside time for studying.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![techno gamerz youtube marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-2.jpg)

But after seeing potential in what Techno Gamerz was doing, his brother encouraged him to post more often. His first viral video was for Dragon Ball Z, a downloading tutorial. This video garnered a massive 250K views, boosting his channel's profile. The young YouTube star has never looked back since then.

Meantime, you must be asking yourself how YouTube generates income in India. It's simple; via AdSense! YouTube's RPM (Revenue Per Mile) metric per 1,000 views varies between countries. In India, the video-sharing platform pays $0.50 per 1,000 views. This means that Indian YouTube teachers and influencers can earn $500 after garnering 1 million views.

But nothing is cast in stone on YouTube. Most Indian channels can earn between $800 and $2,500 after reaching 1 million views. However, this depends on where you get the most views from. For example, if at least half of your views are from the US, you'll earn at least $1,500\. **Techno Gamerz YouTube income** per 1,000 views is approximately $1.21.

Remember that there are some conditions to meet before you start earning money on YouTube. First, the channel must be active for at least a year and have a minimum of 1,000 subscribers. That's not all; you'll need nothing less than 4,000 watch hours to be on YouTube's payroll.

With that said, below are some YouTube stats about the **Techno Gamerz monthly income**, number of views, and more:

| Estimated Monthly earnings in USD/Indian rupees | $167K            |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Estimated Yearly earnings in USD/Indian rupees  | $8.6 million     |
| Total video uploads                             | 858              |
| Type of videos                                  | Gaming tutorials |
| Subscribers                                     | 29 million       |
| Video views                                     | 7.5 billion      |
| Last 30 days' views                             | 7 million        |

As expected, Ujjwal Chaurasia has a massive following on other social media platforms, especially on Instagram. Here, the 20-year-old has more than 2 million followers and over 250K likes on "ujjwalgamer." He usually posts selfies, pictures, and a few gaming contents on Instagram.
