It sounds easy to have your ISO files stored in your USB flash drive. Just copy the ISO images and you've done! Frankly, it's not that simple. Different from burning an ISO image to a new DVD disc, copying ISO image to USB type-C or other types of USB storage devices is much more difficult. 

This is because common USB flash drive, including the latest USB type-C is formatted with NTFS, FAT32, HFS+, APFS, or EXT2,3,4, which impose file size limits on media contents. For example, the FAT32 only allows you to **store files smaller than 4GB**, which seems ridiculous to store the large ISO image that is sized from 4.7gb to 9.4gb for a single movie. What's worse, you cannot play ISO image on many media players or devices directly from the USB drive. It's advisable to convert ISO image to USB supported formats like MP4, which is also known for its wide compatibility with TVs, computers, laptops, gaming systems, and so on.
