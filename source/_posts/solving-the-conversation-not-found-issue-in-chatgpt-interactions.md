##  Check Your Internet Connection

 When ChatGPT says “Conversation not found,” check and ensure your internet connection is working. A non-working connection can break your web browser’s link to ChatGPT, forcing the site to display the above error message.

 To check if your internet connection has issues, open a new tab in your web browser and launch a site. If your site fails to load, [your internet is faulty](https://article-posts.techidaily.com/pioneering-medical-messaging-in-digital-advertising/). In this case, [restart your router](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/updated-chuckle-centric-ringtone-websites-guide/) and see if that resolves your problem. Other options to try include [rejoining your Wi-Fi network](https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-send-and-fake-live-location-on-facebook-messenger-of-your-tecno-pop-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) and [fixing your network adapter issues](https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/integrating-bing-ai-chat-into-android-keyboards-step-by-step-guide/). If these methods don’t resolve your internet problem, reach out to your internet service provider (ISP) for further help.

##  Refresh Your ChatGPT Web Page

 After you’ve confirmed that your internet connection is working, the next fix to apply is to [reload your ChatGPT web page](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-turning-images-into-scenes-syncing-beats/). If your web page or your web browser has a minor issue, refreshing the page will fix that, allowing you to get rid of your error message.

 In your web browser, you can refresh ChatGPT by selecting the refresh icon beside the address bar.

##  Log Out and Back Into Your ChatGPT Account

 If refreshing the site didn’t fix your issue, [your login session with the site may have a problem](https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/channel-catalysts-affiliates-aiding-budgeted-buzzers-for-2024/). Such issues are rare, but they do occur from time to time. To fix it, sign out and back into your account on the site.

 Note that you’ll need access to your ChatGPT username and password to sign back in, so keep those details handy.

 While your ChatGPT site is open, in the bottom-left corner, click your profile icon.

![Select the profile picture in the bottom-left corner.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2-chatgpt-profile-menu.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 In the menu that opens, choose "Log Out."

![Select "Log Out" in the menu.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/3-log-out-chatgpt.png) 

 ChatGPT will log you out. Now, sign back into your account using your login credentials.

##  Turn Off Your Web Browser Extensions

 Your web browser extensions let you get more out of your browsers, but sometimes, they cause various issues. Your browser may have a malfunctioning extension, causing ChatGPT not to load your conversations.

 In this case, turn off all your extensions in your [Chrome](https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/easy-instructions-for-performing-a-successful-chromecast-update/), [Firefox](https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-contacts-from-samsung-galaxy-m54-5g-to-other-android-devices-using-bluetooth-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/), or [Edge](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/in-2024-bringing-text-to-life-3d-creation-in-photo/) web browser, then reload the ChatGPT site. If your site loads just fine, your extensions are the culprit. Find the culprit extension by re-enabling one extension at a time until the error occurs, then remove that extension from your browser.

##  Contact ChatGPT Support

 If your conversations with ChatGPT still don’t load, contact the site’s support team and see if that can help you. ChatGPT’s technical team may have a fix for your issue.

 To contact them, in the ChatGPT site’s bottom-right corner, click the question-mark icon and choose "Help & FAQ."

![Select "Help & FAQ."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/4-chatgpt-help-faq.png) 

 In the bottom-right corner of the web page, click the chat icon. Select "Send Us a Message," choose "ChatGPT," and keep following the on-screen instructions. Once you’ve sent your message to ChatGPT, expect to receive a response in about a week. In the meantime, you might want to [try using a ChatGPT alternative](https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-must-know-methods-to-record-on-your-ipad/).
