Even something as small as your **YouTube video thumbnail background** can strongly impact your results.

Obviously, choosing the right **custom YouTube background** is important. And, now that it’s winter, this requires a special approach.

## Why Are Seasonal Backgrounds Effective?

There are several important reasons why a seasonal YouTube video background or photo, and other elements are very effective and engage us more.

The main reasons include:

* Creates a meaningful connection;
* Boosts engagement with fellow winter lovers;
* Builds a better brand;
* Enhances everyone’s mood, especially during the holidays.

So, whenever you can and whenever there is an opportunity, don’t be afraid to use a seasonal **YouTube video background download**.

Now, before we dive into the examples themselves and the tutorial on how to make the best backgrounds yourself, here are several factors you must consider before proceeding.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Content Relevance

As a video creator, you must ensure to be consistent with your elements. This includes your **background tune for YouTube videos.** For example, if you’re talking about books in your video, including a bookshelf in the winter background makes all the difference.

### Audience Appeal

If you already have an audience, regardless of its size, you should definitely consider what they like and don’t like. You should then leverage this information to create highly appealing content for them and adjust your background scenery accordingly.

### Lighting and Visibility

Another thing you must ensure is to keep your background simple and not too distracting. Remember, even though you have the **best background for YouTube videos**, you still need to realize that it’s not the main focus of the video. It’s just there to make it better.

### Personal Branding

If you want to improve your brand identity and get your name known by more people, incorporate your logo, name, or something similar in the background. It will have a small but meaningful impact, and it’s easy to do.

### 2\. **Auto Synchronization**

The auto-synchronization feature allows you to effortlessly match your audio with the video. This makes it sound more clear and gives your audience a better watching experience.

### 3\. **Auto Reframe**

With the rise of YouTube Shorts, reframing your videos is now more of a necessity than an option. You need to appeal to both YouTube viewers and those who consume content in the vertical orientation. The Filmora Auto Reframe feature allows you to automatically resize your videos with no editing skills needed. To use this feature:

##### Step 1Start the Auto Reframe Feature

One of the ways is by clicking on the Auto Reframe option when you launch Filmora. The other option is to import the media and right-click on it to find the Auto Reframe feature.

##### Step 2Adjust the Aspect Ratio and Motion Speed

Define the aspect ratio in the dialogue box that opens. A widescreen has an aspect ratio of 16:9 while a vertical one is 9:16.

![auto reframe 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/where-to-buy-a-monetized-youtube-channel-a-complete-guide-14.JPG)

##### Step 3Analyze and Auto Reframe the Video

After adjusting the settings, tap on the Analysis option. This will prompt Filmora to analyze your video for completion. The video will be automatically reframed to your specified aspect ratio and speed.

##### Step 4Preview and Export the Reframed Video

You can now preview the final video to make sure it runs as desired. Make any changes if necessary, and export the reframed video in MP4 format, ready for uploading to YouTube.

## **Conclusion**

The first step to running a successful channel is to be accepted into the YouTube Partner Program. However, building a YouTube Channel from 0 views to meet the eligibility status can be difficult. That’s why buying a monetized YouTube channel is a great place to start. You will only need to focus on creating highly engaging content to continue earning and growing your channel. To ensure that the content you create is of high quality, we recommend using Wondershare Filmora. The video editing software comes with fantastic features that help you create great videos for your channel.
