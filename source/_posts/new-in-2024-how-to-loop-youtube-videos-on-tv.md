* 1\. Open Microsoft Paint and open the thumbnail image that is above 2MB size
* 2\. Now go to the File menu and click **Save as** then select JPEG picture
* 3\. Select the location you want the file to be saved to
* 4\. The thumbnail picture will be reduced to Kilobytes only while maintaining the image quality

### 2\. How can I create an attractive youtube thumbnail?
