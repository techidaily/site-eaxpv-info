## Hosting a Webinar for Free

The world's largest video sharing platform also features broadcasting options that enable its users to schedule events and thus host webinars free of charge. Previously known as the Google Hangouts on Air, the YouTube Live feature is fairly simple to set up, but before you start your first webinar you will need to choose a landing page and a chatbox. If you already have a website you can simply copy and paste the embed link and create a landing page for your webinar, or you can use landing pages software products such as [LeadPages](https://www.leadpages.net/) or [Unbounce](https://unbounce.com/) if you don't have your own online domain. For setting up chatboxes for your webinars we recommend using [Chatroll](https://chatroll.com/) or [RumbleTalk](https://www.rumbletalk.com/) platforms, although you'll have to pay a fee if you choose to chat with your audience using these computer programs. So here's how you can host your first webinar on YouTube for free.

#### Step 1. Create a YouTube Event

If you don't already have an account on YouTube, you'll have to create one before you can schedule your first live event. After making sure that you are logged in to your YouTube account head over to the Creator Studio, and click on the Live Streaming tab. Select the New Live Event option and proceed to insert the basic information about the event such as the title, date when the event should take place, tags or a short description of the webinar you're planning.

The Advanced Settings tab will enable you the access to options that will allow you to assign the license and the owner of the webinar. You can also choose the language, set the location or select the category of the event.

#### Step 2. Copy the Embed Code and Paste it To Your Webinar's Landing Page

When you adjust all the settings for your upcoming event, you should click on the Share button. This action will grant you access to the video's embed link, so you can just copy it to your website, or to the landing page you've created with the appropriate software.

#### Step 3. Add the Chatbox to The Webinar's Landing Page

Communicating with the audience during the webinar is important, and for that reason, embedding the chatbox link on the webinar's landing page is a crucial step that will allow you to interact with the participants of your webinar. Chatbox platforms for live events such as [Chatroll](https://chatroll.com/) or RumbleTalk offer amazing features, but they cannot be used for free, which means that you'll have to invest a certain amount of money in order to include a chatbox in your webinar.

#### Step 4. Publish the Webinar's Landing Page and Get the URL

Making the event public a week or a few days before it takes place will provide you with enough time to promote it. Include the webinar's landing page URL in the promotional social media posts and make sure to send out invites for your webinar to your friends and colleagues. Email marketing methods can help you get a larger number of attendees, which is the reason why investing time in the promotion of your webinar can prove to be extremely beneficial.

#### Step 5. Start your Webinar

Hit the Go Live Now button, when you are ready to start your first webinar and enjoy sharing your skills and knowledge with your audience. Even though YouTube offers a simple way to host webinars for free, it lacks the advanced options that enable you to use the prerecorded footage, keep track of the webinar's analytics or create virtual whiteboards and polls.

## Precision in Performance: Utilizing Social Blade for YouTube Data

# Use Social Blade for YouTube Analytics - Stats & How to Use Them

Want to learn how to use **Social Blade** for YouTube? SocialBlade.com is a free-to-use website that displays your YouTube statistics – or the stats of any channel you are interested in – using an intuitive layout.

While many of the stats you can find on Social Blade are also available right on YouTube, some people find it easier to read on Social Blade. YouTube provides you with a lot of information, and a lot of it might not be useful to all creators.

1. [**Your YouTube Analytics**](#yourstats)
2. [**Spying on Other Channels**](#spy)

## Your YouTube Analytics

![Social Blade for YouTube Analytics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/social-blade-youtube-analytics.jpg)

Social Blade is an excellent place to gauge the growth of your channel. It provides statistics on our subscribers, views, and estimated revenue.

To start using Social Blade, type your channel name into the search bar.

On the top section of the page, several stats will be clearly displayed.

First, you will see the letter grade assigned to your channel by Social Blade. If it is not a very good one, keep in mind that channels with over 10, 000 might still only receive Cs. Only YouTube megastars are getting As and Bs.

Next to your grade are your subscriber and video view ranks, as well as a rank assigned to you by Social Blade.

On the second line, you will see the views and subscribers you got in the last 30 days and the percentage by which you are up or down. Simply searching for yourself and glancing at this line is the easiest way to see whether your channel is growing, even easier than in your YouTube Creator Studio.

The final line of the first section will show you an estimate of your monthly revenue.

If you scroll down to the second section you will be able to see your views, subscribers, and estimated earnings per day rather than per month. Growth is in green and loss is in red.

By looking at this chart you can see which videos benefited your channel most after they were posted (your videos are not listed, but you can see based on the day you posted them). This will give you a good idea of what your audience wants to see.

## Spying on Other Channels

When you check your stats, you type your channel name into the search bar. If you want to use Social Blade to monitor somebody else’s stats, type their channel name instead.

By looking up your direct competitors (channels about the same size as yours within your same genre) you will be able to see which of their videos are performing best for them when you combine the daily information Social Blade provides with your knowledge of what videos they posted when.

Knowing what is working for your rivals will help you [design your content strategy](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

You can also use Social Blade to look up huge YouTube stars who you admire, just to see how well they are doing. Take their estimated revenue with a grain of salt, though – it’s just an estimate.

 That's how you can use Social Blade for YouTube - have you ever used it?
