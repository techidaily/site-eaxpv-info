Live streaming on YouTube is a great way to get more engagement from your audience, even if you do not have a huge following. As long as you have some reliable subscribers leaving comments on your videos you should be able to schedule a live stream and know it will have an audience. People feel a personal connection with their favorite vloggers so if you give your subscribers a chance to interact with you in real time they will probably plan to join in. The key to a good live streaming is to respond to comments and questions from people who are watching. Besides watching the live chat of your video you can create a hashtag for your stream and monitor it on twitter.

## Why Livestream?

You have grown your audience, and now you want to take your channel to the next level and diversify your content.

Whether you are vlogging, gaming, or running tutorials on YouTube, there is potential to host a live broadcast. It’s not limited to any genre, you simply need to create content that people are interested in watching.

Before we get started into the How, let’s start with a few reasons Why you should be live streaming your content.

#### Connect and engage with your audience

When a viewer leaves a comment during a livestream you will be able to see it right away and respond. Having an instantaneous conversation with a viewer while they are watching your video will encourage more engagement and establish a ber relationship with your viewers — and you will know that these viewers are not bots.

#### Increase watch time and session watch time on your channel

If you are making YouTube videos on average 10 minutes long, and the viewer only watches half of it, that’s only 5 minutes of watch time, which is fine... But if you are live streaming for 45 minutes, and you are able to hold the viewer's attention, you can surpass what your regular videos can do.

#### Make videos faster

As a YouTuber, you are always striving to be more efficient. Live streaming allows you to do that as you can set up and go. The content you end up creating during the duration of your livestream can then also be condensed into a highlight reel or a recap.

With a bit of planning before you go live, you can create a week’s worth of content in one go, instead of having multiple schedules for livestream content and your standard publishing videos.

## Type of Content to Livestream

Live streaming has a lot of value, but what type of content should you be streaming?

Here are a few popular ideas for content that will attract viewers to your livestream:

#### **Q&A session**

#### **Unboxing**

#### **Game or challenge**

#### **Sneak preview or review**

#### **Live events** (just make sure the Internet can support it)

#### **A demo or a tutorial**

#### **A live commentary or (if you are a gamer) Let’s Play video**

## What You Need to Livestream On YouTube

#### A Plan or Outline

It’s good to know what your livestream is going to be about before you start. Is there a key message you want to hit, an action you want your viewers to take, or a structure you want to follow.

Just because it’s live, doesn’t mean it all has to be improvised. If you go in without a plan, you might end up feeling flustered or getting stressed out. Allow for spontaneous comments or events to take you off your initial plan, but always return to your outline so you know how to wrap up your livestream when you have to.

#### Stable Internet Connection

You cannot conduct a quality livestream, if your Internet is bad. When evaluating your internet connection for live streaming on YouTube, look at the Upload speed. Depending on the quality of your video, these are the minimum upload speed rates your Internet will need to perform:

480p = 1.5 mbps

720p = 3 mbps

1080 = 5 mbps

In addition, be aware of external causes that may be slowing down your internet such as someone else using it, a poorly performing router, or a damaged cable.

#### Camera

If you have a smartphone or a laptop with a webcam built in, that is the best camera for you to get started live streaming. It’s good to have a milestone and work towards a more advanced camera, but until then, don’t feel discouraged because you don’t have expensive gear. If you have a smartphone, a laptop, or a basic webcam, that’s perfectly fine.

#### Microphone

You don’t need a great microphone for live streaming, you only need a good one. If you do want to spend several hundred to a thousand dollars for a professional studio microphone, nobody will stop you, but know this, a mic that is easy to use is as important as the audio quality as you develop a consistent live streaming schedule.

#### Streaming Software (For Higher Quality Streams)

Once upon a time, to livestream on YouTube, you needed additional software to capture content from desktop, camera, microphone, etc, called encoding software — but not anymore.

Those encoding software, such as [OBS](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [Wirecast](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and [VMix](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), are required if you are producing content that requires a high frame rate such as gaming, but not mandatory if you are simply vlogging or running a tutorial.

If you are using Chrome, you can[stream live on YouTube without using an encoder](https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/youtube-rolls-out-a-new-feature-that-lets-you-go-live-from-the-desktop-without-an-encoder/).

#### A Capture Card (For Higher Quality Streams)

You will need a capture card when you are capturing footage from a different PC or console. If you are a gamer and you are using one PC to stream and one PC to play your game, then you should consider getting a capture card.

## 4 Ways to Setup Your Livestream On YouTube

There are 4 main ways you can start live streaming on YouTube. The one that works best for you depends on the content you are going to be streaming.

#### 1\. Camera/Go Live (Chrome Browser)

By accessing [www.youtube.com/webcam](https://www.youtube.com/webcam) on the Google Chrome browser, you can start streaming immediately through your connected webcam. This way is best for a simple Q&A or letting your viewers know your thoughts in a timely situation. This method does not require an encoder.

 There are 3 ways to access livestream this way:

1\. Click [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/webcam) to connect to your YouTube channel

2\. You can access it from the top menu on YouTube

![access livestream](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/access-livestream1.jpg)

3\. You can access it by clicking Camera under the Live Streaming tab in your Creator Studio

#### **2\. Google Hangouts On Air (Quick)**

Another way to livestream without an encoding software is by using the Google Hangouts On Air feature.

This is great if you want the feel of your livestream to be similar to a board meeting, where you can invite people, split screen, and share screen to illustrate your point.

Here’s how you can access this Google Hangouts On Air:

**Step 1:** Go to Events under the Live Streaming tab in your Creator Studio

**Step 2:** Click New Live Event button on the top right corner

![new live event button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/new-live-event-button2.jpg)

**Step 3:** Enter the event’s Info and Setting page. Fill out the details of your Livestream, and under Type, select **Quick** (using Google Hangouts On Air).

![new event info and setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/new-event-info-and-setting3.jpg)

**Step 4:** You can schedule your livestream or Go Live immediately by clicking one of the blue buttons on the left-hand side.

#### **3\. Mobile**

Live streaming via your mobile device gives you a lot more freedom to maneuver. You can walk around and give your viewers a tour — but remember to stay within the WiFi or LTE range. That means you still won’t be able to livestream well inside an elevator.

Here’s how you can livestream on mobile:

**Step 1**: Access the YouTube app and make sure you are signed in to the account you want to livestream from.

**Step 2**: At the top, click on the camera icon

**Step 3**: Click on Go Live

  **Pro Tip:** When live streaming, always hold your smartphone horizontally. This allows your video to be oriented as a landscape, instead of a portrait.

#### **4\. Custom Encoder**

The fourth way of live streaming on YouTube is with encoding software. This is the recommended method if video quality is essential, such as gaming videos.

**Step 1**: Download and install an encoding software. In this example, we’ll be using [OBS](https://obsproject.com/).

**Step 2**: Open OBS

**Step 3**: Go to YouTube Creator Studio and enter the Stream Now page

![youtube creator studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-studio4.jpg)

**Step 4**: Under Encoder Setup, copy Stream name/key (Warning: DO NOT share this key with anyone)

**Step 5**: Return to OBS and enter the Setting menu on the lower right-hand side of the application

**Step 6**: Click into the Stream tab

a) Under Stream Type, select Streaming Services

b) Under Service, select YouTube/YouTube Gaming

c) Under Server, select Primary YouTube ingest server

d) In Stream Key box, paste the Stream Key you copied from YouTube

e) Click Apply and then OK

**Step 7**: Plug in your webcam

**Step 8**: In the main OBS dashboard, under the Sources menu, click the + icon and add Video Capture Device. You should now see visuals from your Webcam.

**Step 9**: Select the Resolution you want for your video and click OK

**Step 10**: Return to your YouTube Streaming Page and fill out the details of your livestream

**Step 11**: Go back to OBS and click Start Streaming

**Step 12**: See on YouTube Streaming Page at the top that you are Live. You are officially streaming. Once You are finished streaming, return to OBS and click Stop Streaming to end the stream.

## 8 Tips to Improve Your Livestream on YouTube

#### Do Speed Test

Before you start your livestream, do a speed test of your Internet. Check out from [**here**](http://www.speedtest.net).

#### Have Good Lighting

Be aware of your surroundings when you are about to livestream. You don’t need the top-notch lighting kit, you can simply sit beside a window and allow natural lights to illuminate your stream.

#### Shoot A Live Test (Unlisted)

Have a technical rehearsal by doing a livestream test, then rewatching it, and evaluating the quality of the audio and visual.

You don’t have to worry about your audience logging in and seeing your test if you set the Privacy of the stream to Unlisted.

#### Look at the Lens, Not the Screen

If you are streaming with the selfie camera on your smartphone or using your camera’s viewfinder to make sure you are in the frame, remember that you need to be looking at the lens — not the image of yourself.

Eye contact is important in building trust, and if you are looking at yourself, it will appear as if you are looking past your viewers instead of at them.

#### Show It To Your Viewers

Whatever you are talking about, if you can, show it to your viewers. YouTube is a visual medium, and that means your viewers can become disinterested if there’s nothing visual holding their attention.

In the beginning, you probably won’t have a multi-camera setup, so you cannot cut away from your livestream. However, you can share the screen and you can bring physical objects into a frame.

If you are talking about your dog, show her on camera. If you’re presenting something with a lot of steps, create a Powerpoint slideshow.

Consider what visuals or props you can add to your livestream to enhance your performance.

#### Find A Way to Make it Evergreen

[Evergreen content](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/10/16/guide-to-evergreen-content-marketing)refers to content that is relevant for a great length of time. Talking about an event isn’t evergreen, because the event will soon pass and become old news. However, giving some tips for how to plan an event would be evergreen content.

Since your livestream will be saved on YouTube and your viewers can replay and watch it. They’re more likely to enjoy it if the content is relevant and interesting.

#### It Doesn’t Have to Be Long

A livestream doesn’t need to be 40 minutes long. It only needs to be long enough for you to get your story across — and if you want to answer some questions and engage with your audience. As soon as your story is over, even if it’s only 5 minutes, that’s okay. Don’t stress about the length of your stream, it’s not an endurance competition.

#### Allow Yourself to Make Mistakes

Another thing you shouldn’t worry about at all is making mistakes. When you are doing livestreams pretend you are engaging with someone in real life. In real life, you aren’t able to edit out your mistakes, whether it’s a word mispronounced or coffee spilling. Roll with it and laugh it off.

## How to Grow As A Livestreamer on YouTube

#### Let People Know When You Are Streaming

Give people enough time to schedule it in, don’t spring it on them in the last minute. Share it on social media, your website, and any other means.

#### **Create a Streaming Link 2 Days Before**

Share your livestream link via social media to remind everyone to tune in when you go live. Looking for your link? It should look something like this: <www.youtube.com/user/\[channelname\]/live>

#### **Reach Out To the Communities Most Interested**

If you are going to be live streaming about a specific topic, such as photography, you should reach out to those who are interested in the topic. Highlight what aspect of photography you are going to be streaming and attract new viewers to your content.

#### **Be Aware of Time Difference**

If you have an international audience, find time to livestream where you can get the optimal amount of viewers.

You can find the location of your main demographic in your [YouTube analytics](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### **Create a Channel Trailer to Promote Livestream**

Make a video and host it as your channel trailer, that way anyone who lands on your YouTube page will see the promo for your livestream.

#### **Promote Through Feature Content and Channel**

YouTube has a feature that enables you to use your existing content to promote your upcoming livestream.

Here’s how to set it up:

## **Key Takeaways**

1. Live streaming will help you make more videos, engage with your audience, and grow your channel.
2. You don’t need expensive equipment to livestream on YouTube, you only need a webcam and a microphone.
3. YouTube has made live streaming as easy as a few clicks, no additional software needed unless you are gaming.
4. Always do a test run of your livestream to ensure the internet, audio, and visual are all working properly.

## Building an Engaging Sports Highlight Reel

# How to Create a Sports Highlight Video

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

_“I want to make a **sports highlight video**, but I don’t know how to edit it or what kind of tools I need to use. Can someone tell me how to work on a sports video?”_

As I read this query posted on a popular online forum, I realized that so many people out there find it hard to create a sports video. Well, unlike a standard video, working on a sports highlight video can be tough. This is because it needs a lot of editing and we need to handpick the right moments from hours of footage. Though, if you use the right tools, then you can easily work on highlight videos like a pro. In this guide, I will let you know how to create sports videos in a step by step manner.

* [Part 1: Why is a sports highlight video and why important?](#part1)
* [Part 2: Highlight Video vs. Skills Video](#part2)
* [Part 3: Use Excellent Video Editor to Make a Sports Highlight Video](#part3)
* [Part 4: How to Create a Sports Highlight Video?](#part4)
* [Part 5: Expert Tips for Creating Highlight Videos](#part5)

## Why is a sports highlight video and why important?

As the name suggests, a highlight video basically includes all the vital events of a game in a short duration of time. You can include the details of some players at the start or focus on a particular player as well. Besides that, a sports highlight video would have fast-forward, slow motion, and frozen clips to skip or focus on certain details.

A lot of times, people don’t have the time to watch the entire game, which can span for a couple of hours. Therefore, they can watch a sports highlight video that would include all the major events of the game and will let them enjoy their thrill in a few moments.

![Sports Highlight Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sports-highlight-video.jpg)

Besides that, if you are applying for a college/academy or just want to showcase your skills, then you can consider making a sports video of an impressive game of yours. You can simply showcase a player and try to highlight their skills in the video.

## Highlight Videos vs. Skills Videos: the Major Differences

While making a sports video, you might encounter two different types of content – a highlight video and a skills video. As I have mentioned above, a sports highlight video would include the shots of an actual game. You can either focus on the event of a single game or include clips from multiple games that were played in a genuine setup. If you want, you can highlight a particular player while making the video as well.

On the other hand, a skills video is mostly made to demonstrate the skills of a player and is not focused on the game. In fact, most of the skills videos are made outside of a real game setting. For instance, if you have mastered a skill or would like to demonstrate your game-related actions, then you can make a skills video. Some of these videos are also tutorial game-plays to teach others about a particular skill that they can master.

## Use Excellent Video Editor to Make a Sports Highlight Video

If you want to come up with engaging and visually appealing highlight videos, then consider using a versatile video editor like **Filmora**. Equipped with several video editing tools, it will let you create a sports highlight video in no time. Since the tool has so many features, you can save your time in editing and come up with a new sports video in minutes.

## How to Create a Sports Highlight Video with Filmora?

With the help of [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), anyone can create a sports video without even prior editing/designing experience. Firstly, you can install Filmora on your Windows or Mac by visiting its website and have the footage you wish to edit. Now, you can just follow these steps to work on your next sports highlight video.

[Filmstock Stock Media Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg)](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-sports?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle)

#### Step 1: Add a video to Filmora

To start with, just launch Filmora on your computer and add the video that you wish to work on. You can just drag and drop the video to its interface or go to its Menu > File > Import Media to browse and load the file.

![Import Media File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/import-media-file-to-filmora-1.jpg)

#### Step 2: Edit the Sports Video

In order to create a sports highlight video, the first thing that people do is trim any unwanted part. Once the video is loaded, you can view it on the timeline of the interface. Now, go to the timeline and get the trim tool to manually select the part of the video you wish to trim. After selecting the desired fragment, you can trim the clip or just delete it by clicking on their respective icons.

![Edit Sports Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-sports-video-1.jpg)

In the same way, you can also split your video and make other changes in it. You can also include multiple videos together and include them in your timeline as well.

If you are including multiple videos, then make sure they have the same dimensions and aspect ratio. For this, you can select the video, right-click on the timeline, and click on the crop icon. Now, select the same aspect ratio for the entire video to keep it uniform.

![Edit Sports Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-sports-video-2.jpg)

Most of the game highlights that we see have different speeds for various sections. That is, some actions would be fast-forwarded while some would be in slow motion. To apply this, simply select the section in the timeline, right-click, and go to the Speed and Duration settings. This will open a dedicated interface from where you can change the speed of the sports video.

Apart from manually setting the speed, you can also take the assistance of the custom speed options that are available in the timeline tools.

![Edit Sports Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-sports-video-3.jpg)

#### Step 3: Make Advanced Edits in your Sports Video

With the user-friendly interface of Filmora, you can do some basic edits and make a sports highlight video in minutes. Though, if you want to focus on some parts and make more changes, then you can use its advanced options as well.

For instance, in a highlight video, we often wish to freeze certain frames. To do this, just select a frame and use the “Freeze Frame” option from the timeline tools. You can even set the duration to freeze the selected frame.

If you have included clips from different videos, then you can apply all kinds of transitions from Filmora. In the end, you can go to its edit options and choose to close gaps as well.

To give your video a uniform and aesthetically pleasing appeal, you can also add different overlays and effects on it from Filmora’s library.

Lastly, make sure that you added sound or voiceover to your video. You can add a sound from its library or import any other music file to it. Since highlight videos mostly have voiceovers, you add the same by visiting the Record > Record Voiceover option.

![Edit Sports Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-sports-video-4.jpg)

#### Step 4: Export your video in the desired format

That’s it! Once your sports highlight video is ready, you can export it in different formats. Just go to the Export option and select the location to save the video and a preferred resolution. You can save your video in formats like MP4, WMV, AVI, FLV, MKV, and so on.

## Expert Tips for Creating Highlight Videos

As you can see, making a sports highlight video with a tool like Filmora is extremely easy. Although to be a pro and make better videos, you can consider the following tips:

#### Keep it short

Make sure that you only include the highlights of the game in your video to keep it interesting. Your aim is to have a short and crisp video without any unwanted footage.

#### Use freeze frames and slow motion

Some games can be pretty fast-paced and the viewers might miss out on a few key details. To showcase them, you can freeze certain frames or apply slow motion.

#### Include other details

A sports highlight video can also be informative. You can include details about the players or the team at the start. Also, it is recommended to have sound or a voiceover in the background to narrate the events.

#### Pick the best clips

When you watch a game, make a note of the best moments that you know your viewers would enjoy. You can also focus on different skills that you found impressive and include them in your sports video.

I’m sure that after reading this guide, you would be able to come up with an impressive sports highlight video as well. Since you might need to make a lot of edits on a sports video, I would recommend using a diverse tool like Filmora. With the tons of editing options that it provides, you can easily create all sorts of highlight videos while saving your time and resources.
