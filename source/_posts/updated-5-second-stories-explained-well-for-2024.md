##### Step4 Fix Size and Positioning of your Video

![fix size and positioning](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sourav-joshi-income-on-youtube-2022-10.jpg)

For this step, you can use editing interface, so you can work on your video’s position. Drag the sliders to the interface and change the size, position, and direction of your footage.

##### Step5 See Advance Editing Option

When it comes to making a video 10x impressive, use Filmora’s advance editing sounds like a great move.

Simply access the editing panel by double-clicking the video. After this, you can perform the following:

## Wrap Up

Becoming a content creator and earning in dollars seems like a dream job. But not everyone understands that it needs a lot of effort and patience to reach this level of success on YouTube.

Although the journey is unpredictable, it doesn’t hurt to try. See Sourav Joshi for an example. His art or creativity paved a way for him and made him a successful YouTuber in such a young age.

You can try creating a video for YouTube. And use Filmora to make your videos impressive and aesthetically pleasing.
