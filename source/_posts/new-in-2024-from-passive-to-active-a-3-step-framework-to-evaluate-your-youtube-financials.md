## Part 2: How your YouTube earnings are calculated

Having known how to check YouTube income, if you’re still wondering how your earnings are calculated, here, we’ve discussed all the necessary information you need to know about how YouTube earnings are calculated.

YouTube earnings are calculated based on different factors. From CPC to CPM, estimated gross earnings per view, and more. Keep reading to find out more about how these factors affect your YouTube earnings;

**CPM (Cost Per Mile):** CPM is the amount an advertiser pays for every one thousand views of their ads. This means if an advertiser is paying you $10CPM, you’ll earn $10 on every 1000 views of their ads.

**CPC (Cost Per Click):** Most people think CPC is the same as CPM, but no they are not. Cost Per Click is the amount an advertiser pays for every viewer that clicks on their ads. If an advertiser is willing to pay $10, then you’ll earn $10 on every ad click.

**Estimated Gross Earning Per Subscriber:** You’ll notice whenever you watch a YouTube video, the creator always emphasizes you click the Subscribe button to get a notification on every new video he/she uploads. Well, they do this because the more subscribers they get, the more likely their videos appear in search results.

Also, if you have a huge Subscriber base, your videos tend to get more views, thereby increasing ad views, ad clicks, and your earnings.

All the factors explained above will determine how your YouTube earnings are calculated. However, keep in mind that you’ll receive only 55% of the total dollar advertisers pays while YouTube keeps the remaining 45%. If you get an average of $5 from an advertiser on every 1000 ad view, you’ll earn $5 x 55% which is approximately $2.75.

## Part 6: Frequently Asked Question About Looping Videos on iPhone

1. **What is a looping video?**

It means a video that repeats for a specific number of times or maybe an unlimited amount of times automatically. For example, a GIF.

1. **Can I loop videos an unlimited number of times?**

Yes, it is possible to loop a video an unlimited amount of times. You can learn **how to loop a video on iPhone** by using the methods that we discussed above in the whole article. It is not possible to save the infinitely looping because it will take an infinite amount of memory.

1. **Does the view count if I play a YouTube video in a loop?**

No, YouTube will not count repeated views if they all come over and over again from the same sources. This is to maintain the overall quality of YouTube and make it scam-free.
