Several weeks ago I wrote an article about 7 best audiobook player apps for Android. And some of iOS devices users ask me to write an article to introduce some useful audiobook player apps for iOS devices. Everyone wants to look for a perfect audiobook player for their iPhone. And it usually take us a lot of time to find a good one which has a nice UI and the ability to remember by position when I last paused and see M4B chapters and their names. If you haven't found your favorite audiobook player apps yet, here I have collected 6 best audiobook player apps for iOS devices for your recommendation.

#### 1\. Bookmobile

Easy-to-use, clean design, full control and audio from more sources. Bookmobile provides a better experience for listening to audiobooks than any other app. While it's interface is a bit hard to get used to, you can use it to change the playback speed with more granular settings than iBooks or the Audible app, skip ahead or back by minutes or seconds and there's even a driving mode, with simplified playback controls for use in the car. Bookmobile can play books you've synced to iTunes or you can use iTunes File Sharing to add files to it directly. You can also add books from Dropbox or other cloud services, and download them from web URLs.
