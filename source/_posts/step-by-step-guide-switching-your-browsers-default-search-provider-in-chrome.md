 Google makes the Chrome browser, but that doesn't mean you have to use Google as your search engine if you use Chrome. It's very easy to use Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, and any number of other search engines, and it's easy to do. We'll show you how on the desktop and mobile devices.

 Chrome, on all platforms—including Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iPhone, and iPad—can change the default search engine. This determines which search engine is used when you type in the address box. Google obviously wants you to use their search engine in Chrome, but you don't have to do that.

##  Desktop or Laptop Computer

 First, open the Google Chrome web browser on your [Windows PC](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Mac](https://www.google.com/chrome/), or [Linux](https://www.google.com/chrome/) computer. Click the three-dot menu icon in the top-right corner of the window and select "Settings" from the menu.

 Select "Search Engine" from the sidebar, then choose one of the search engines from the drop-down menu.

 From this same area, you can edit the search engines by clicking "Manage Search Engines and Site Search." Here, you can edit and remove the provided search engines and [create your own custom site searches](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/smart-recorder-solutions-for-lecturers-for-2024/).

##  iPhone, iPad, or Android

 Open the Google Chrome app on your [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-chrome/id535886823), [iPad](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-chrome/id535886823), or [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU210698/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) device, then tap the three-dot menu icon in the top or bottom right corner to find the "Settings" menu.

Android / iPhone

 Unfortunately, the mobile version of Google Chrome doesn't allow you to add your own search engine. You have to choose from the list provided.

 That's all you have to do. Now, when you type in the address bar, Chrome will search with your preferred search engine.
