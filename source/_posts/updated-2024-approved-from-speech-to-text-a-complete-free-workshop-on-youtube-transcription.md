## Part 1: How to Transcribe YouTube Video Automatically for Free \[2 Ways\]

Besides the [basic video editing features on the YouTube](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) platform, you can now quickly **transcribe YouTube videos to the text** as well. The good thing is, you can either use the automatic transcription feature that YouTube offers, or upload it manually while adjusting the timing as you go further.

Below are the two methods to transcribe your YouTube videos for free:

### Method 1: Use the Automated Transcription Service on YouTube

As the name suggests, YouTube automatic transcription service works automatically. This means you don’t even have to click the ‘Transcribe’ button anymore to **transcribe a YouTube video**, and the website takes care of it on its own. All you need to do is, choose English as the language of the video when setting up subtitles. You can follow the instructions given below to do so:

#### Step 1  Upload a Video

Sign in to your YouTube account, click your profile picture from the top-right corner, and click **YouTube Studio** from the menu. Next, click **CREATE** from the upper-right corner, click **Upload videos** from the menu, and drag and drop a video from your computer to the **Upload videos** box that appears next.

![Upload YouTube videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-upload-video.jpg)

#### Step 2  Select Transcription Language

On the **Details** page of the next box that appears, scroll down and click **MORE OPTIONS**, and select **English** in the **Video language** drop-down list under the **Language, subtitles, and closed captions (CC)** section.

![Select Language on YouTube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-language-on-youtube.jpg)

#### Step 3  Publish the Video

Follow the on-screen instructions from this point to publish the video, and wait while YouTube automatically transcribes and [adds the close captions](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to it.

**Note:** Depending on the duration of the clip, the time YouTube would take to transcribe may vary.

After YouTube has transcribed the video, you can **download the transcription file** in your preferred format. The instructions are given below explain how you can do so:

1. **Get to the Subtitles Window**

While on the **YouTube Studio** page, click **Subtitles** from the left pane to go to the **Channel subtitles** page. And then click the video you want to modify.

1. **Get to Classic Studio**

In the video subtitle page of the target video, hover mouse on the **Published Automatic** status under the **Subtitles** column, click the **Options** icon (with three vertical dots) that appears, and click **Edit on Classic Studio**.

![YouTube Classic Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-edit-on-classic-studio.jpg)

1. **Download Transcription File**

![YouTube videos transcription](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-youtube-video-transcription.jpg)

### Method 2: Get YouTube Transcription when Watching

In addition, if you are watching any other video, you can make YouTube transcribe that for you as well. You can follow the instructions given below to get the **YouTube video to text transcription**:

**Step 1: Play the Video**

Go to the video on YouTube and start playing it. Make sure NOT to get to full-screen mode as doing so would hide the option to transcribe the clip.

**Step 2: Enable Transcription**

Click the **More** icon (with three horizontal dots) from under the bottom-right corner of the video player, and click **Open transcript** to see the video transcription in the **Transcript** pane that appears in the right.

**Step 3: Manage Timestamps**

Click the **Options** icon (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner of the **Transcript** pane, and click **Toggle timestamp** to enable or disable the timestamps in the video transcription.

#### Limitations of Using YouTube Transcribe

Although YouTube’s automatic transcription is a decent feature that saves you a lot of time, since Google uses machine learning algorithms to convert the speech to text, the level of accuracy may vary depending on the accent of the speaker, and the clarity of the audio the video has. Also, even sometime you may not be satisfied with the end-results.

Alternatively, you can use Kapwing to **transcribe a YouTube video** and download the transcription file with the below step-by-step instructions:

## Part 3: Benefits of Transcribing YouTube Videos

You may need video transcriptions for several reasons, such as analyzing the summary of the entire speech in the video, extracting a single phrase or quote that was spoken in the clip, or making the video helpful even for those suffering from hearing impairment. When you **transcribe a YouTube video**, the transcript can be useful in many ways. Some of the most common benefits of transcribing a video include:

* **Search Engine Optimization**

When you add subtitles, the text can appear in Google search results when someone types a similar phrase in the search box. This helps get more views to your videos, thus giving your channel popularity, and you, monetary gains in the long run.

* **Accent**

If the speaker in the video is from a different region and is using an accent that you are not much comfortable with, you can turn on the subtitles and read the dialogs along with the video.

* **Repurposing on Blogs**

If you own a blog that you have embedded your video to, the transcription could be used to add text to it so the target audience can get a fair idea of what the video is all about. This is useful because many people prefer reading over watching.

### YouTube Video Transcription FAQs

#### 1. How to Transcribe YouTube Video to Text

Usually the transcription files have \*.srt extension that are globally accepted and supported by almost all media players. However, there might be instances when you want to have the subtitles in plain text.

That said, to convert an SRT file to TXT, you can:

* Right-click the **SRT** file
* Go to **Rename**
* Replace **srt** with **txt** and press **Enter**
* Click **OK** on the confirmation box that appears next to convert SRT to TXT

After this, you can simply double-click the file, and read and modify the transcribed content as needed.

#### 2. How to Edit and Upload Edited Transcript to YouTube

If you made any modifications to the transcript that was automatically generated by YouTube or any other third-party transcription tool, you can follow the steps given below to upload the new file to the YouTube video:

* Go to **YouTube Studio** and then to the **Channel subtitles** page as explained earlier
* Expand the **Languages** column of the target video
* Click the **Options** icon that appears under the **Subtitles** column when you hover mouse on to it
* Click **Edit on Classic Studio**
* On the next page, click **Edit** from the top-right corner

![Edit YouTube subtitles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-automatic-youtube-video-transcription.jpg)

* Click to open the **Actions** drop-down list from the upper-left corner
* Click **Upload a file**
  * Follow the on-screen instructions from there to upload the modified transcription file
  * Click **Save Changes** from the top-right corner of the page when done

**Conclusion**

If you are looking for a quick and easy way of adding subtitles to your videos, letting **YouTube transcribe** for you could be a good approach. However, because these auto-generated transcriptions are created by machine learning algorithms, their accuracy cannot be counted on. Therefore, the best way to get the job done accurately is, let YouTube auto-transcribe your video, download the transcription file, make the necessary changes to it, and then upload the file back to the video.

## Visual Sizzle: How to Make Your YouTube Logo Pop

Gaming videos have become increasingly popular on YouTube, especially among young people. It is not uncommon for older folk to enjoy this type of content, especially if they want to unwind after a long day. However, the industry is becoming pretty crowded, making it harder for content creators to stand out from the crowd.

An excellent way to get your target audience to notice you would be to design a killer YouTube banner that will immediately cause anyone scrolling past to click on your video. Stick around to learn how to create a great gaming YouTube banner with templates.

## Importance of a Banner for Your YouTube Gaming Channel

Imagine a scenario where you want to open a brick-and-mortar store. One of the most important things you need to get out of the way is the business name. Once you have settled on a fitting name, you will then move on to create a sign to place outside your shop.

For example, a banner for your YouTube gaming channel plays a similar role to signage for a brick-and-mortar shop.

* An excellent banner helps you make a solid first impression on your viewers, some of who is viewing your content for the first time.
* Secondly, a well-designed banner reflects positively on your brand and helps you grow your audience at a steady rate.
* Thirdly, you can use your banner to give your viewers a rough idea of what your video is about without them clicking to watch. A suitable banner can cause anticipation to build within your viewers. Once the video is over, they won’t resist visiting your channel to see what else you offer.

## Guide to YouTube Gaming Banner Size

We can liken a banner for your YouTube video to a book cover to a novel you have been dying to read. Therefore, it would be wise to get the size right if you want to create an excellent first impression for yourself. Ideally, the best size for a YouTube banner is 2560\*1440 pixels or an aspect ratio of 16:9.

We urge you not to upload a banner smaller than 2048\*1152 pixels, or else the image will appear cropped. Keep your banner within 1235\*338 pixels and centered on the screen to be on the safe side.

This YouTube banner dimension is ideal for viewing on any device since your audience might use their smartphones or laptop to watch your videos on YouTube. Lastly, ensure you keep the file to a maximum of 6MB. We believe this file size is pretty generous.

## Tips for Designing an Attractive Gaming YouTube Banner

Below are some tips that will help you create beautiful YouTube banners.

Simplicity is key: Contrary to popular belief, a simple banner looks more polished than a complex one. If your YouTube banner has too many elements, your viewers using their mobile phones might have a challenge viewing the image.

Ensure the graphics are high-quality : Nothing is as frustrating to your viewers as seeing a blurry or pixelated YouTube banner. However, high-quality graphics with a resolution of at least 1920\*1080 pixels make your work look polished and attract more viewers to your channel.

Leverage the grid system: Some of your viewers might watch your videos from their smartphones, and others on their laptops or tablets. The grid system allows you to ensure the full banner will be visible no matter what device your audience will use to watch your gaming videos.

Add a CTA: At the end of the day, you are trying to grow your audience on your YouTube channel. You might also have other social media platforms where you post content. Since your banner is one of the first things your audience will see, you could include a short, easy-to-read, and understandable call to action. For instance, you could encourage them to “Subscribe Now!”

Incorporate your unique color scheme: By now, you already have a theme for your YouTube channel that your existing subscribers associate with you. As you design your YouTube banner, ensure you incorporate your theme colors, so new visitors know what colors to look out for as they scroll on the platform.

## Why Use Templates To Create Gaming YouTube Banners?

They are also systematized, meaning you can download a template specifically for YouTube that comes in the correct dimensions.
