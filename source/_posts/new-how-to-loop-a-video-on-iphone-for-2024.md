## Part 1: How to Convert iPhone Live Photos to a Loop Video

A loop video is a short video that plays in repeat/ indefinitely. Loop videos can be created with features on social media apps and third-party apps.

iPhone has a setting that allows you to edit the photos to loop or bounce videos, and it only works with a photo feature called 'live photo'. The live photo feature records 1.5 seconds moving picture when you click on the shutter button.

The live photo feature can be edited to create a loop video, and you can do that by following these steps:

1. Before creating the video, you need to have the live picture saved on your phone.

To do this, capture a live photo by opening your camera app. Then click on the live photo icon, which is located in the upper right corner. And tap on the shutter button.

1. Afterward, you locate the live photo you want to convert to a loop video by going to the Photos apps. Then click on _Albums > Media Types> Live photos._

![iPhone Media types](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-live-photos-media-types.jpg)

1. After locating and clicking on the live picture, you will see the _Live_ tab in the upper left corner. Click on the arrow down to view other options, including Loop, Bounce, and long exposure.

![iPhone live photos options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-live-photos-options.jpg)

1. Select the effect you want to create (loop) and save the file. The loop feature plays the video in a one-way order. So, to make it more interesting, you can select the bounce effect, which makes it play back and forth.
2. You can share the created loop video with the share icon at the lower-left corner.

## FullView Media Collaboration Guidebook

# Fullscreen Partnership: How to Choose An MCN

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

[0](#commentsBoxSeoTemplate)

There are quite a few different YouTube partnership agreements that you can go for, depending on your needs and preferences. For instance, a Fullscreen partnership agreement requires you to share a percentage of your revenue in exchange for access to Fullscreen’s partnership perks. These perks include customized thumbnails as well as channel banners.

### How to Get a Fullscreen Partnership

Now that we’ve covered what the partnership actually is, let’s go ahead and take a look at how to actually become a Fullscreen partner. There are a few things that you should take into account before deciding to go down this road. There are regulations that your account needs to abide by. Let’s take a look:

1. Your account cannot have any copyright strikes and must be in good standing.
2. Your channel needs to be at least 30 days old.
3. You must have at least 1,000 subscribers.
4. You need to have received at least 100 views per day for the last 30 days.

If you meet these requirements, and Fullscreen sounds like a good fit for you, go ahead and [apply for partnership](http://fullscreenmedia.co/apply/). The first thing that you need to do is go to the Fullscreen website and find the Channels page. Scroll to the lowest point and request more information. Click the button to trigger the appearance of a form and write a message to Fullscreen. Once you’ve sent your message, Fullscreen is going to take between 1 and 7 days to respond. If accepted, you will have to sign a contract and provide screenshots that confirm that your account is in good standing on the YouTube.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### How Fullscreen Pays You

You’ve entered into a partnership agreement – now you need to start getting paid. The process is simple.

Fullscreen will pay you through PayPal. They will calculate how much you’ve earned, and you will get that amount transferred to your account. Make sure to check the amount that you’ve earned from the dashboard of Fullscreen itself.

Becoming a Fullscreen partner might be a good idea for your channel if the perks appeal to you. However, think about your own skills and whether you are confident in your ability to keep on growing your channel yourself. Fullscreen provides you with a wide range of comprehensive marketing tools, but a lot of video creators are able to master YouTube marketing using the tools YouTube already provides. Before you agree to split profits with an MCN (in addition to the portion already claimed by YouTube), make sure you are really going to be earning more profits than you could alone.
