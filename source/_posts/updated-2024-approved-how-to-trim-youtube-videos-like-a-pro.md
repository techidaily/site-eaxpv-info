## How to Trim a Video After You Upload it to Your YouTube Channel?

The **YouTube Studio** is no longer in beta phase, which means that the feature is here to stay. This is good news for all video creators who frequently update their YouTube videos after they upload them, as they no longer have to go through the endless uploads just because they wanted to trim a video.

Make sure that you’re signed into your YouTube channel, then click on your **profile picture** and select the **YouTube Studio (Beta)** option. On the left side of the screen, you’ll be able to see a menu that contains different subcategories like **Analytics, Dashboard or Videos**, so just click on the **Videos** option and proceed to select a video you’d like to trim. After the Videos submenu appears on the screen you should click on the **Editor** option and the video you selected will open in the YouTube’s video editor.

In this way, you don’t need to take down the original video, edit it and re-upload. One of the benefits of trimming YouTube videos with the Trim feature in YouTube Editor is that this will keep your video URL and views and ranks etc.

## Trimming a Video Before Posting On YouTube with Filmora Video Editor

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### Method 1: Trim on Timeline

YouTubers who don’t want to rely on YouTube’s video editing capabilities can trim their footage with Filmora (to be honest, the Editor in YouTube platform has limited features). Filmora video editing software for PC and Mac computers offers a few different tools for trimming videos. After you’ve created a new project in Filmora, you should import a video clip into the editor by clicking on the **Import** drop-down menu and select the **Import Media Files** option. Each file you add to a project will be displayed in the **Media tab**, and you can just **drag and drop** it to a video track on the timeline.

All you have to do in order to trim a video after you’ve placed it on the timeline is drag **one of its ends to the left or to the right**. As you drag one of the clip’s edges the editor will only display **the remaining footage** while rendering the rest invisible. If at any point you want to access a portion of the video you’ve trimmed you just have to **extend the file by dragging it** until you’re able to see the segment you’re searching for.

![Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Trimmer  Tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/trim-sides.gif)

#### Method 2: Using Filmora Split Tool

Filmora’s **Split tool** can help you separate the portion of the clip you want to remove from the segment you’d like to keep. Simply **place the playhead** at the exact location in the video clip where you want to make **a cut**, and click on the **Split icon** that looks like a pair of scissors. After the video is split, you should click on the clip you no longer need in order to select it and then hit the **Delete** button on your keyboard to remove it from the timeline.

#### Method 3: Using Scene Detection

Wondershare’s video editor also offers an **automatic way to split a video** clip into a number of separate scenes. **Right-click** on the video file located in the Filmora’s Media tab, and select the **Scene Detection** option from the menu and proceed to click on the **Detect button**, after the **Scene Detection window** pops up on the screen. The software will then **automatically analyze the footage** and divide it into separate scenes. Simply click on the **Add to Timeline button** once the process is completed to continue editing the video clip you’ve just split.

#### Method 4: Using Instant Cutter Tool

The **Instant Cutter Tool** enables you to quickly trim or merge high-resolution files recorded on action cameras as soon as you import them into a project in Filmora. Select the **Import with Instant Cutter Tool option** from the **Import drop-down menu** and wait for the **Filmora Instant Cutter** window to appear on the screen. In the upper left corner of this window, you will be able to see **Trim and Merge tabs**. Make sure that the **Trim tab** is selected and then click on the **Open File button** to import a video clip you’d like to trim. You can then use **the trimming sliders** to designate the parts of the video you’d like to remove or the set the **In and Out points** by clicking on the **Set In Point or Set Out Point icons**. Click on the **Export button** to save the new version of the video clip and **click OK** to complete the process.

## **Conclusion**

Running a YouTube Channel is lucrative. Although it may take time to build a following, YouTube is a great platform for generating revenue. Most YouTubers have monetized their channels through the YPP program. The program allows you to earn revenue from the ads that show up in your videos. This means that a successful YouTube needs high-quality videos. We recommend Wondershare Filmora for editing your videos and improving their rate of engagement with the audience. This is a key step in building recurring revenue with YouTube monetization options.
