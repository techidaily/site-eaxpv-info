## Thorough Examination of the Anker MagGo (6600mAh) - Assessing Its Oversized Design and Efficient Charging Capabilities

### Key Takeaways

* Qi2 tech in Anker MagGo Power Bank allows 15W charging on the go with newer iPhones.
* The portable battery's hinge offers customizable angles when charging or using the phone.
* Bulk is the main downside as the battery is thick and awkward to handle when using the phone.

 If you have an iPhone 12 or newer, then you also have access to Qi2 technology. Because of this, Apple finally allows for 15W charging on third-party power banks and batteries. That’s where the [Anker MagGo Power Bank (6.6K)](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Certified-Ultra-Fast-MagSafe-Compatible-Adjustable/dp/B0C9DNYKMJ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002753&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fanker-maggo-power-bank-qi2-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) comes in as a solid portable battery. Coming in with a $70 (retail) price point, an adjustable hinge, and enough power for a full charge, this battery is great for on-the-go charging, so long as you have big pockets.

##  Qi2 Puts This Portable Battery Ahead of the Pack

 With the introduction of Qi2 to this battery, you’ll find that compatible devices (iPhone 12 and newer) can enjoy 15W charging while on the go. This isn’t relegated to just when plugged into external power, like Apple’s official MagSafe Battery either. The Anker MagGo delivers the full 15W without being plugged into the wall. In addition to that, should you plug it into a compatible charger (30W or better ideally), you’ll be able to charge the battery _and_ your iPhone at the same time. Add to that the fact that this charger supports MagSafe accessories, your phone will be able to charge in style here. It can sit vertically or horizontally, and if you set your new iPhone in landscape mode, it’ll enter [StandBy mode](https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-here-are-different-ways-to-find-pokemon-go-trainer-codes-to-add-to-your-account-on-apple-iphone-6-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/) and display your customizable screen.

 The fact that the battery is Qi2 also means that whenever Android handsets start to support the standard, they’ll be able to enjoy the speediness of 15W charging, too. And, with Qi2, it’s possible that the charging speed could increase in the future. The foundation behind the Qi standard said they hope to increase the speeds sometime this year, though there’s no real definition as to what they’ll increase to, or when it’ll happen.

##  The “Kickstand” Is More of a Magic Keyboard-Style Hinge

 I’ve used several MagSafe batteries in the past, and most of them have had a built-in kickstand of sorts. While a kickstand is nice, I rarely use it because it’s typically only at one angle and it’s never the angle I need. Well, Anker went another route with the MagGo 6.6K. Instead of the usual kickstand where a little piece of plastic flips out of the back to prop up the battery, you’ll find a hinge that’s akin to Apple’s Magic Keyboard for iPad. It locks into just about any angle you set it and holds its place very well. This lets you customize your device's angle, which I’ve never seen a battery like this do before.

 Whether you’re doing a FaceTime call, or you watching YouTube, the Anker MagGo 6.6K ensures your iPhone can sit at the perfect angle. This, alongside 15W charging, are the two stand-out features of this battery.

##  Bulk Is the Only Downside Here

![The Anker MagGo Power Bank with its charging cable-3](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/04/the-anker-maggo-power-bank-with-its-charging-cable-3jpg_53467946113_o-1.jpg)

 While the hinge is a nice mechanism, it does add a lot of bulk. The battery itself is separate from the charging plate, which means there’s additional thickness here that other MagSafe batteries don’t deal with. At nearly 1 inch thick, and sticking out past the bottom of my iPhone 15 Pro when attached, this battery is not for the faint of heart when being used on the go.

 While I can fit it in my cargo shorts pockets, it’s not the most comfortable thing to use when out and about. And, I couldn’t imagine a woman trying to fit it into a smaller purse or pocket. However, if you plan to travel with the MagGo and use it at a desk, table, or other area like that, it’ll excel.

 If you try to use your phone while holding the battery, it gets a bit awkward due to its size. I have larger hands, and the MagGo still felt awkward to hold in my hand while attached to the phone. I ended up just simply holding the battery and not my phone, which meant I could only use one hand when typing. Or, I would open the kickstand and hold the kickstand portion with one hand and type or use the phone with the other.

 I know the [Anker MagGo Power Bank (6.6K)](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Certified-Ultra-Fast-MagSafe-Compatible-Adjustable/dp/B0C9DNYKMJ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002753&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fanker-maggo-power-bank-qi2-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) is a portable battery and meant to be used on the go, but at more than twice the thickness of my iPhone 15 Pro (with camera lenses), it’s a chunky battery for sure—really the only downside here. It’s got a capacity of 6,600mAh and allows you to recharge your phone a few times over. It delivers 15W wireless charging and even does passthrough charging. It’s magnetic and has an amazing kickstand. But, it’s huge.

 If you’re looking for a battery that can be used at Starbucks, an airport, or in the car, then this is the perfect thing for you. However, if you want to power up with a battery in your pocket or purse while walking around, I think the MagGo 6.6K will struggle a bit to fit the bill there. It’ll _do_ the task perfectly, but it’ll be bulky in the process.
