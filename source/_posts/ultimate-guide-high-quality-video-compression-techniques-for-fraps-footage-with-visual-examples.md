The file size of videos recorded using Fraps can be always ginormous - a three-minute clip is **3GB to 15GB** in file size, so you'll get **30GB-150GB** footage recordings if the game you are playing lasts 30 minutes. It's quite normal that you have huge Fraps video files because the screen capture utility uses lossless codec and records raw data without any video reduction. If you are one of those who are looking for best ways to [compress Fraps videos for faster YouTube upload](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) or for saving space, read our tutorial that will save you a lot of headaches. 

## How to Compress Fraps Videos While Recording

Ready to capture game footage using Fraps? Hold on. There're a few tricks to let Fraps output smaller file size. If Fraps captured videos still have big file size, then turn to [HD video compressor for Fraps](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

**1.** **Lower down video resolution**. Video resolution affects file size greatly. A single minute 4K Ultra HD (3840x2160 pixels) clip at 30fps is roughly 389MB, while a 1080p video at 30fps only takes about 120MB. The video resolution Fraps capture depends on the source video you are playing, so you can lower the source video resolution to decrease Fraps video file size. Another way is to adjust video capture settings on Fraps. Click Movies, and select Half-Size under Video Capture Settings category, and Fraps will record videos with lower resolution.
