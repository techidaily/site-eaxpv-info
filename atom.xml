While it’s usually fast, sometimes Safari can be slow or laggy. When this happens, it can be bothersome, and some might even download another third-party browser.</p><p> If you’re noticing that Safari is running slow on your iPhone, there are several things you can do to speed it up again. Give these tips a try, and hopefully, Safari will be at full speed in no time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.dbschema.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=19867419&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/176b22bab4e94a28619ca2433b2ef241/products/1_icon256.png"                      border="0"                ><br>DbSchema database designer for all databases, schema design in the team, schema deployment, interactive diagrams, documentation, data and query tools. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Check-Your-Internet-Speed"><a href="#Check-Your-Internet-Speed" class="headerlink" title="Check Your Internet Speed"></a>Check Your Internet Speed</h2><p> Before passing the blame on Safari, it might be a good idea to check your internet speed. That way, you can make sure Safari is the issue and rule out anything else before continuing.</p><p> If you’re connected to Wi-Fi, open another computer or device on the same Wi-Fi network, then head to <a class="link"   href="https://www.speedtest.net/" >Speedtest’s site <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and check your internet speed. You won’t want to do this on your iPhone, as Safari issues can slow your connection time, giving you a false negative.</p><p> If your internet speed is fast, then Safari is the issue, and it’s time to fix it.</p><h2 id="1-Close-All-Your-Safari-Tabs"><a href="#1-Close-All-Your-Safari-Tabs" class="headerlink" title="1.

Safari, like most apps, uses device storage to store data from the app. And low storage means Safari won’t have enough memory to work.</p><p> This is why some users find Safari temporarily faster once they clear their browsing history and data.

As a content creator, you go toiling several processes to ensure its success. More so, you are probably building a brand and want people to know about your product or services. What about one easy way to remember the URL and share it with your potential subscribers? Besides sending such links to people, you’ll be reminding them to subscribe with just a click. And that’s YouTube auto-subscribe link. It is a more effective way than asking or directing to check your YouTube channel. They’ll probably not find it easy, maneuvering around numbers of other channels that bear names close to your channel. A visitor will quickly give up. You can save them the crap and engage more effectively.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1468905&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_728x90.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/create-youtube-subscribe-link-1.png"                      alt="youtube auto subscribe link"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How to subscribe to a YouTube channel?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to create an auto-subscribe link for your YouTube channel?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Other tricks that work besides YouTube auto-subscribe.</a></p><h2 id="How-to-subscribe-to-a-YouTube-channel"><a href="#How-to-subscribe-to-a-YouTube-channel" class="headerlink" title="How to subscribe to a YouTube channel?"></a>How to subscribe to a YouTube channel?</h2><p>A YouTube auto-subscribe link will be beneficial in many ways.

Here are the possible reasons for that.</p><p>• Spinoff Channel<br>A content creator may decide to come up with a Spinoff channel.

Extensions may change your browser’s settings and make the “Unsubscribe” option unavailable. Try disabling all of your browser extensions, then check back if YouTube still subscribes you to channels unknown to you. If so, solve the issue by uninstalling the specific extensions. These could be ad blockers or free VPN extensions.</p><p>• Someone else can hit the button<br>Do you share your computer with other fellows?

Since it’s a free and simple way to make extra bucks, showing ads with the content you produce for online platforms, it’s essential to know how much it pays for views.</p><h3 id="Pay-Per-1-000-Views-by-AdSense-1"><a href="#Pay-Per-1-000-Views-by-AdSense-1" class="headerlink" title="Pay Per 1,000 Views by AdSense"></a>Pay Per 1,000 Views by AdSense</h3><p>For 1,000 views, expect AdSense to pay around $8-$20. However, your total earnings will depend on factors such as your content type, users’ location, and setting of ads in Google AdSense, so it can pay on thousand views.</p><p>More so, AdSense opts for Revenue Per 1,000 impressions or (RPM) to showcase the amount you would get for 1,000 impressions. Remember, this RPM doesn’t include the actual amount you’ve earned. But it focuses on dividing your earnings by page views and impressions, then multiplying those by 1,000.</p><p>You can also refer to the formula for better understanding.</p><p><strong>Formula:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/190515" >RPM &#x3D; (Estimated earnings &#x2F; Number of page views) * 1000 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>From this formula provided by Google official, we can easily know that</p><p>Estimated earnings &#x3D; (RPM * Number of page views) &#x2F; 1000</p><p>To understand it further, see the example below.</p><p>Suppose you’ve earned around $0.10 from 20 page views; your page RPM would be $6.00 in simpler terms.</p><p>($0.10 &#x2F; 25) * 1000 &#x3D; $6.00</p><p>Also, if RPM is $4.00 from 45,000 ad impressions, your estimated earnings would be equal $180.00</p><p>($4.00 * 45,000) &#x2F; 1000 &#x3D; $180.00</p><h3 id="AdSense-Pay-Per-View"><a href="#AdSense-Pay-Per-View" class="headerlink" title="AdSense Pay Per View"></a>AdSense Pay Per View</h3><p>Lastly, if you’re looking for an exact answer regarding how much it pays per view, know that it varies and is based on different factors, such as niche or audience demographic.</p><p>But you can expect something between $8 to $12 on 1,000 views after monetizing your YouTube channel with your Google AdSense account.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993650">                    <video width="720" height="300" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993650">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:720px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993650%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993650/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 2: How Much Does AdSense Pay Per Click?<p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-does-adsense-pay-per-1000-views-2.jpg"                      alt="pay per click"                ></p><p>After understanding AdSense’s way to pay for 1,000 views, formula, or pay per view, here’s what you need to know about AdSense’s payment on per click policy.</p><p>On Average, you can expect AdSense to pay something around $0.20 to $15 on a click. Talking about estimated earnings or one click, it depends on the cost-per-click in the niche, including the publisher’s earnings and competition among rival advertisers.</p><p>And if you’re wondering, cost-per-click is when a user clicks on your ad, and you earn money for it. However, advertisers always decide the cost-per-click for ads. In this case, some advertisers don’t hesitate to pay extra, depending on what they intend to advertise.</p><h2 id="Part-3-AdSense-Earnings-Per-Thousand-Pageviews-Examples-1"><a href="#Part-3-AdSense-Earnings-Per-Thousand-Pageviews-Examples-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: AdSense Earnings Per Thousand Pageviews Examples"></a>Part 3: AdSense Earnings Per Thousand Pageviews Examples</h2><p>From pay per 1,000 views to pay per click, understanding the AdSense payment policy is essential if you’re up to monetize your YouTube channel.</p><p>Since there’re YouTube AdSense requirements, such as audience demographic, niche, or content, learning about which niche is the lucrative one will also help you decide your next move.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the following examples for better understanding:</p><ul><li>For example, if arts and entertainment is your niche, you can expect to earn <strong>$5.62</strong> after accumulating 1,000 pageviews.</li><li>Creators who create content on vehicles can earn <strong>around $9.20</strong> on every 1,000 pageviews.</li><li>If you’re into beauty and fitness, expect to earn <strong>up to $13.01</strong> on 1,000 pageviews.</li><li>For real estate, health, home, and garden niches, you can earn <strong>$14.50, $17.40</strong>, and $23.35 on every 1,000 pageviews.</li></ul><p>Remember, people from North America can make the most of these earnings. But worry not if you are based outside North America. Because Google AdSense revenue calculator can help you find the average pageviews on monthly basis.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Earnings-from-AdSense-Factors-to-Consider-1"><a href="#Part-4-Earnings-from-AdSense-Factors-to-Consider-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Earnings from AdSense: Factors to Consider"></a>Part 4: Earnings from AdSense: Factors to Consider</h2><p>After learning how much you can earn in different niches, it’s equally important to focus on the following factors, so you can qualify and start earning from AdSense with ease.</p><h3 id="1-Type-of-Content-1"><a href="#1-Type-of-Content-1" class="headerlink" title="1) Type of Content"></a>1) Type of Content</h3><p>To monetize your videos for AdSense, ensure that you own the rights to use visuals and audio elements of your video. And focus on creating all elements of your video yourself.</p><p>For YouTube, you can try creating tutorials, do-it-yourself videos, original short films, original music videos, home videos, travel vlogs, or even daily-life vlogs.</p><p>While creating content for YouTube, remember advertisers consider placing ads on more advertiser-friendly content.</p><p>As a blogger, you must provide unique but quality content to exceed AdSense’s eligibility criteria. Having unique content helps Google understand what your website is about. It’s even better if your website provides a one-of-its-kind experience and users visit it again.</p><p>Be it a vlog or blog, please ensure that it’s original and not a copy from other sources. This way, you can elevate your credibility on the respective platforms. For a great user experience, opt for intuitive navigation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-does-adsense-pay-per-1000-views-3.jpg"                      alt="adsense calculator"                ></p><p>And to up your content game, you can even use the calculator to determine the value of your content and estimated revenue from AdSense.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://martinic.evyy.net/c/5597632/1422856/4482" target="_top" id="1422856"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4482-1422856"                      border="0" alt="" width="580" height="309"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Keywords-1"><a href="#2-Keywords-1" class="headerlink" title="2) Keywords"></a>2) Keywords</h3><p>Keywords are phrases and words that describe your service or product.

This strategy will put your ad in front of potential buyers.</p><h3 id="3-User-Location-1"><a href="#3-User-Location-1" class="headerlink" title="3) User Location"></a>3) User Location</h3><p>Remember, AdSense follows geo-targeting strategy, so it can place ads on different pages. These ads are based on a user’s language, region, and IP address.</p><p>Put simply, ads serving to a user from Algeria may differ from the ads for a user from Georgia.</p><h3 id="4-Time-Requires-to-Get-Views-1"><a href="#4-Time-Requires-to-Get-Views-1" class="headerlink" title="4) Time Requires to Get Views"></a>4) Time Requires to Get Views</h3><p>There’s no fixed time frame; however, you can focus on search volume, audience, and competition to start getting the desired number of views.</p><p>The first 60 minutes are crucial after you post a video. Then, the next 24 hours and the first 48 hours are equally important because YouTube gives an unnatural boost to it. It helps YouTube observe responses, such as how viewers interacted with the video and what kinds of viewers were interested in it.</p><p>Remember, if a video fails to get any views in a couple of days, it won’t likely perform and will consider “dead” on the platform.</p><p>More so, if a video performs better slightly, it’ll start to reach its full potential in the next 3 to 6 months, according to the views it receives per day. Oftentimes, videos took up to a year to perform well.</p><p>And if your video starts to perform better and faster in those 3-6 months, it’ll likely do better in the longer run.</p><h3 id="5-Video-Duration-1"><a href="#5-Video-Duration-1" class="headerlink" title="5) Video Duration"></a>5) Video Duration</h3><p>Focus on the length of your video, as it determines how many ads can be shown in it. This part also influences your earning potential. When your video is longer in length, it’ll increase its worth.</p><p>However, you must find the right balance between video duration, quality, and the number of videos on your channel, so you can continue to earn without hindrance.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://proteahair.pxf.io/c/5597632/1983634/23621" target="_top" id="1983634"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1983634"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983634/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Your-Niche-or-Industry-1"><a href="#6-Your-Niche-or-Industry-1" class="headerlink" title="6) Your Niche or Industry"></a>6) Your Niche or Industry</h3><p>Niche is another essential factor to opt for AdSense earnings.

About a month ago, you had to have 10,000 lifetime views on your YouTube channel to qualify for monetization. However, earlier this year, Google changed their eligibility requirements and made them even tougher.</p><p>As of February 20, 2018, YouTube channels need to have accumulated 4000 hours of ‘watch time’ over the past 12 months and no less than 1000 subscribers to qualify for monetization. If you do not meet these requirements you cannot join the YouTube Partner Program and monetize your YouTube channel.</p><p>So, the first step to successful monetization on YouTube is to actually grow your channel. You need to create videos that will attract viewers and engage your audience. You also need to get people to subscribe because this is really what will grow your YouTube channel over time.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Enable-Monetization-for-Your-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Enable-Monetization-for-Your-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Enable Monetization for Your YouTube Channel"></a>Part 2: How To Enable Monetization for Your YouTube Channel</h2><p>Here’s the step-by-step process for monetizing your YouTube Channel, for those who are qualified.</p><ol><li>Log in to your YouTube account.</li><li>Find your account icon in the top right corner. Click it to find the ‘Creator Studio’ button.</li><li>Click the ‘Creator Studio’ button.</li><li>Click the ‘Channel’ option in the left side menu.</li><li>You’ll see a drop-down menu under ‘Channel’. Click on ‘Status and Features’. This is actually the first option on the menu. It should open by default once you click the ‘Channel’ button.</li><li>Look through the ‘Status and Features’ page and click the ‘Enable’ button beside monetization.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-youtube-monetization.jpg"                      alt="enable youtube monetization"                ></p><ol><li>Clicking the ‘Enable’ button should lead you to another page where the guidelines for monetization are explained. Take the time to read through the guidelines and understand the dos and don’ts of YouTube monetization.</li><li>Once you’ve looked through the guidelines, click the ‘Enable my account’ button to proceed. This will lead you to a page where you’ll be prompted to join the YouTube Partner Program.</li><li>Read through the YouTube Partner Program terms, check the appropriate boxes, and click the ‘accept’ button.</li><li>You’ll be prompted to link an AdSense account.</li><li>Connect an existing AdSense account if you have one or create a new one.</li><li>Once you’re done linking an AdSense account, you’ll be redirected to YouTube. There, select the type of ads you want to run under ‘Monetization Preferences’.</li><li>Click the submit button and wait to find out if your account is approved for monetization.</li></ol><p>According to YouTube, it can take up to a week for a decision to be reached on your application.</p><p>YouTube will not review your monetization application until you’ve met their eligibility criteria. Even then, your application may be declined if your videos do not follow the community guidelines (i.e. channels which simply repost content from other channels will not be monetized).</p><p>Not all videos can be monetized. While there are legal ways to create videos consisting of imagery and footage belonging to others, be aware that such videos are not always eligible for monetization. YouTube will only monetize videos that you own. So, posting videos which do not belong to you or which include copyrighted content can cause your monetization application to be declined.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Linking-Your-Bank-Account-To-Your-AdSense-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Linking-Your-Bank-Account-To-Your-AdSense-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Linking Your Bank Account To Your AdSense Account"></a>Part 3: Linking Your Bank Account To Your AdSense Account</h2><p>AdSense offers a variety of payment options including mailed checks and Western Union transfers. However, these options may not be available to you depending on where you’re based. AdSense does make payments through electronic wire transfer (EFT – Electronic funds transfer) to virtually every country in the world, and this is the preferred payment option for most people.</p><p>To have your earnings deposited directly into your account through EFT, you’ll need to link your bank account to your AdSense account.</p><p>Here’s a step-by-step guide for linking your bank account to your AdSense account.</p><ol><li>Log in to AdSense via: <a class="link"   href="http://www.google.com/adsense/start" >www.google.com/adsense/start <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li>Click the ‘Settings’ button in the left panel menu</li><li>Under ‘Settings’, click ‘Payments’.</li><li>On the ‘Payments’ page, click ‘Manage payment options’.</li><li>Click ‘Add payment method’.</li><li>Next, you’ll be prompted to add your bank account details. In general, you will be asked to provide the following:  <ol><li><em>Name on the account &#x2F; account holder’s name</em>  </li><li><em>Bank account number</em>  </li><li><em>Bank name</em>  </li><li><em>Bank SWIFT code</em>  </li><li><em>Depending on where you are based, additional information may be required.</em></li></ol></li><li>Ensure that the name on your AdSense account matches the name on the bank account you provide. To edit your AdSense name, click the ‘Manage settings’ button also on the Payments page.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-4-Receiving-Payments"><a href="#Part-4-Receiving-Payments" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Receiving Payments"></a>Part 4: Receiving Payments</h2><p>To get paid by AdSense, you need to reach the $100 threshold. You may wish to set a higher threshold but as a rule, earnings below the $100 will not be processed for payment (you will still receive the money, it will just keep adding up until it gets to $100 and then you’ll be paid).</p><p>Also, bear in mind that AdSense follows a monthly payment cycle. This means that a month’s earnings (assuming they meet the threshold requirement) will be paid next month. Usually, direct deposit payments will be processed between the 21st and 26th of every month. That said, it can take up to 10 days for electronic wire payments to be received.</p><p>In addition to reaching the payment threshold, be sure that you have no payment hold on your AdSense account. A payment hold can cause your earnings to be withheld even if it has reached the payment threshold.</p><p>To avoid a payment hold, be sure to provide the necessary tax information, verify your identity and your address, make sure the bank account linked to your AdSense is verified, and make sure you have not violated any of YouTube’s guidelines and community rules.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Depending on your vlogging skills and the nature of your content (some types of videos get more attention than others), it can take a while for you to be eligible for monetization. And even when you’ve successfully monetized your channel, getting enough views to reach the payment threshold can be tough.</p><p>Don’t let this discourage you from working towards earning income from your YouTube channel. Just focus on creating a YouTube channel people will want to watch. That’s how to get paid on YouTube - be sticking with your channel long enough for it to grow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

You can complete YouTube’s simple course on copyright infringement (<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/copyright%5Fschool" >Copyright School <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) and wait three months. Copyright strikes expire in three months so long as you complete the course (they will not expire if you don’t take the course).</p><p>2. you can contact the holder of the copyright and ask them to retract their claim. You will probably have to offer to delete your video. Keep in mind that it is completely up to the rights holder whether you deleting your video is enough for them to retract their claim. They are allowed to say ‘no’.</p><p>Deleting your video, especially if you do so without contacting the rights holder, will not automatically reverse your copyright strike.</p><p>The majority of copyright strikes that you as a YouTube creator receive – if you receive any – will not be as black and white as ‘someone else owns it, you shouldn’t have used it’. If you know that you have a license to use the song or other media you got the strike for, or feel like your use of a clip falls under ‘fair use’, then your path to reversing the strike will be different.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892108/21290" target="_top" id="1892108"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892108"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892108/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Wrongful-Copyright-Strikes"><a href="#2-Wrongful-Copyright-Strikes" class="headerlink" title="2. Wrongful Copyright Strikes"></a>2. Wrongful Copyright Strikes</h2><p>YouTube’s system for detecting copyright infringement is automated. This means that you can get a copyright strike without actually breaking any rules. These strikes are generally easy to reverse.</p><p>For creators, the most common instance of this is being flagged for using copyrighted music. When you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >download royalty-free music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – whether you download it for free or pay for it – you might not realize that that music is still copyrighted to someone else and can still be flagged by YouTube’s system.</p><p>If this has happened to you, reversing it is simple.</p><p>1. Submit a counter-notification through the form provided and include either your licensing information or a link to where it can be found online.</p><p>2. After you submit your counter-notification, the copyright holder will have 10 business days to respond. Since in this scenario the rights holder will know they have allowed their content to be licensed out, there should be no conflict and your video will be reinstated.</p><p>‘Fair use’ is another thing YouTube’s system has no way of detecting. ‘Fair use’ means that you are using content that you do not own, and which you do not have a license to use, but that you are using it in a way that is legally protected. Satire, criticism, education, and news reporting are areas that may be protected by fair use, although every situation is different.</p><p>There is no situation in which crediting a rights holder, adding a disclaimer, or simply not monetizing your video will make it fair use.</p><p>To reverse a copyright strike where you believe your video should be protected as ‘fair use’, submit a counter-notification through the web form YouTube provides. The rights holder will have 10 business days to provide YouTube with evidence that they have initiated a court action against your content. There is a chance that they will not agree with you about the ‘fair use’ status of your video. You could be in for a bit of a fight.</p><p>If your account has been suspended for accumulating multiple strikes, you will no longer be able to access the online counter-notification form and will have to send a free-form counter-notification. <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6005919" >Information on that can be found here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://newchic.sjv.io/c/5597632/1659704/14420" target="_top" id="1659704"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14420-1659704"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1659704/14420"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Community-Guidelines-Strikes"><a href="#3-Community-Guidelines-Strikes" class="headerlink" title="3. Community Guidelines Strikes"></a>3. Community Guidelines Strikes</h2><p>Most video creators – people who post vlogs, travel videos, and various kinds of tutorials – will never receive this type of strike. Sexual content, hateful content, threats, and scams are among the things you could post which would result in a community guidelines strike. Creators, in general, are not interested in posting cruel or graphic content.</p><p>The only thing some video creators might have to be careful of is <strong>misleading metadata</strong>. You can get community guidelines to strike for intentionally using the title, tags, and description of your video to build up an expectation of the content your video does not deliver on. For example, if you post a personal vlog and title it ‘Call of Duty Review’ to try and capitalize on people who might be searching for gaming videos then you might receive a strike.</p><p>Blatantly using keywords that have nothing to do with your content is not something you can do accidentally, but it is possible to be misleading in your metadata without trying to be dishonest. YouTube is a very competitive place, and many creators are turning towards title strategies which could be considered ‘clickbait’. If you say in your title that you had a baby, but reveal in your actual video that ‘had a baby’ meant ‘wrote a new song’, will that get you a community guidelines strike? Probably not, but it can be a thin line.</p><p>In general, just don’t mention anything in your title or tags which you do not talk about in your video.</p><p>Community Guidelines strikes expire after three months. As long as you only have one strike, it will not affect your channel or what you can do on YouTube. If you receive a second strike within the three months of your first strike, you will lose the ability to post videos for two weeks. If you receive a third strike before either of your previous strikes has expired, your account will be terminated.</p><p> Have you experienced a copyright strike against your YouTube channel?

You should also check whether it is compatible with large-sized files or not. The quality of the video also depends upon the file size. The larger is file size, the higher is video quality. However, you can face problems while uploading huge-sized videos as online content distributors hardly support such files. So you must compress your video before sharing anywhere. There are also some recorders that provide a direct link to social networking sites. Thus you should consider these factors also before purchasing the game recording software.</p><p>You can easily run this recorder on your computer if it is updated and has 8GB of RAM. PC should also have two storage drives so as to install gaming software on one drive and record videos on another drive.

Finding Your Money in AdSense</h3><p>Intuitively, many YouTube creators think that the first thing they see when they open up AdSense should be their daily earnings. This is not the case. Besides how much money you have made, AdSense keeps track of a lot of things the average YouTuber will not find useful. Getting to a report on your daily earnings actually takes a bit of navigation.</p><p>First, click on Performance Report near the top of your screen in AdSense. In the next page there will be a dropdown menu that says Days. Click on that menu and change it to Products.</p><p>In Products, scroll down until you get to a chart where there are two options: <strong>Hosted AdSense for Content</strong> and <strong>AdSense for Content</strong>. AdSense for Content relates to a personal website. For information about your YouTube channel click on <strong>Hosted AdSense for Content</strong>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940317&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adsense-performance-report.JPG"                      alt="adsense performance report"                ></p><p>The next page is a report of how much money you have made from monetizing your YouTube channel.

How are my earnings determined?"></a>2. How are my earnings determined?</h3><p>How much money you make through AdSense depends on your <a class="link"   href="https://www.marketingterms.com/dictionary/cpm/" >CPMs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and EPMs. CPM is an acronym for “cost per mille” and indicates how much money and advertiser is paying for 1000 impressions of an ad. RPM is your revenue per 1000 impressions.</p><p>A lot of YouTubers new to AdSense assume that “per thousand impressions” means “per thousand views”, and that is incorrect. Besides the fact that not all views are monetized, impressions are not views. They are ad clicks. For long, skippable, video ads an “impression” is when a viewer watches the ad to the end instead of skipping it.</p><p>CPMs vary depending on the type of ad, where it is being run, and current advertising trends. Advertisers pay more for certain kinds of ads or for ad space in more popular videos. Beware of MCN scams claiming they can guarantee you a certain CPM; they cannot. Which ads are displayed in your videos is determined automatically by YouTube’s system and depends on factors like how you categorized your videos and how many views they have.</p><h3 id="3-How-do-I-get-paid"><a href="#3-How-do-I-get-paid" class="headerlink" title="3.

Jake’s childhood dream was to play for the NFL. Thinking they might enjoy filming themselves playing football, their father got them a camera. With this camera, Jake and his brother began filming themselves doing skits, pranks, and scripted videos.</p><p>Jake’s favorite YouTube channel at the time was “Smosh,” featuring the comedic duo Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla. Smosh was such an inspiration to them that the two Paul brothers started their own channel, “Zoosh” (notice the similar-sounding channel name?) - their old Zoosh channel and videos are still publicly available on YouTube.</p><p>For the majority of his years in school, Jake was the class clown. As he got older, though, he focused on football and wrestling and made it into his school’s varsity wrestling team. Around this time, Jake also began to contemplate what he would do after high school. Figuring he wanted to join the U.S. Navy SEALs, Jake started training for recruitment.</p><p>But before Jake fully invested his energy into training for the U.S. Navy SEALS, his brother, Logan, convinced him to make videos with him again (by this time, Logan had already built up a large following on Vine, the short-form video hosting service).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://parisrhonecom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896607/21553" target="_top" id="1896607"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21553-1896607"                      border="0" alt="" width="750" height="422"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1896607/21553"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jake-paul-and-his-brother-logan-paul.jpg"                      alt="jake-paul-and-his-brother-logan-paul"                ></p><p>Image resource: <a class="link"   href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-42548207/logan-and-jake-paul-the-brothers-dominating-social-media" >BBC NEWS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Together with his older brother Logan, Jake also amassed a large following and eventually began receiving paid sponsorships, at which point Jake realized that he could make a career out of video content creation.</p><p>Curious, young, and adventurous, at the age of seventeen, after discussing with his mother, Jake dropped out of high school, put aside his pursuit to join the Navy SEALs, and moved to Los Angeles without much of a plan.</p><h3 id="Jake-Paul-and-Disney"><a href="#Jake-Paul-and-Disney" class="headerlink" title="Jake Paul and Disney"></a>Jake Paul and Disney</h3><p>Not wasting a single day in L.A., Jake went straight to taking acting and improv classes, growing his social media, and networking with everyone he could meet in the entertainment industry. In 2015, Jake auditioned for Disney Channel’s comedy series “Bizaardvark” and successfully landed the role of “Dirk.” However, the Disney Channel grew more and more uncomfortable with Jake’s growing image as an outrageous teenager. After Jake made it onto the KTLA 5 news for the noise complaints around his mansion, the Disney Channel fired him from Bizaardvark.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/2016067/18544" target="_top" id="2016067"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-2016067"                      border="0" alt="" width="1020" height="380"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2016067/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>![Jake Paul and Disney](<a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Jake" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Jake <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Paul disney-tubefilter.com.jpg)</p><p>Image resource:tubefilter.com</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1793213">                    <video width="1080" height="1620" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793213">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:1080px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftinyland.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1793213%2F19135'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793213/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### Team 10<p>In 2016, with all of his many exciting experiences, Jake put together a humorous and motivational memoir titled “You Gotta Want It.” As his own social media channels kept on growing rapidly, Jake launched “<strong>Team 10</strong>,” his own influencer management agency comprised of other teen social media influencers. In order to collaborate with one another more easily, they all moved in together to a Beverly Grove mansion that rents for $17,000 USD a month. After Jake publicized his address, the mansion attracted so many fans that neighbors filed multiple noise complaints and even contemplated filing a class-action public nuisance lawsuit against Jake.</p><p>More than a home, the mansion became a film set. The teenage tenants filmed themselves pranking one another and being as outrageous as teenagers can possibly be.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tinyland.pxf.io/c/5597632/1793214/19135" target="_top" id="1793214"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793214"                      border="0" alt="" width="900" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793214/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jake-paul-and-team-10.jpg.jpg"                      alt="Jake Paul and Team 10"                ></p><p>Image resource:venturebeat.com</p><p>On May 30, 2017, Jake uploaded a rap music video with Team 10 titled “It’s <strong>Everyday Bro</strong>.” While Jake is no stranger to making popular videos, the number of views this music video garnered was on another level. The stark difference between the high production quality of the video and the unimpressive lyrical content may have been the perfect combination that catapulted the video’s success.</p><p>As it always happens with all videos that go viral, many YouTubers jumped on the bandwagon and made their own reaction videos to “It’s Everyday Bro,” mostly making fun of Jake. Some big-name YouTubers, including his own brother, even went as far as producing their own “diss track” music video. This drama created even more heavy traffic around Jake, which he cleverly responded with more video content.</p><p>Despite all of these oppositions in his life, Jake continues to work hard to build his social media empire. Looking at all the many strategies he has already successfully executed from such a young age, and I have no doubts that Jake will continue to push the boundaries of social media and content creation in the years to come.</p><h2 id="What-About-Social-Media-Success-Can-We-Learn-From-Jake-Paul"><a href="#What-About-Social-Media-Success-Can-We-Learn-From-Jake-Paul" class="headerlink" title="What About Social Media Success Can We Learn From Jake Paul?"></a><strong>What About Social Media Success Can We Learn From Jake Paul?</strong></h2><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Quick Follower Growth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Through First-Mover Advantage</strong></p><p>When a new social media service pops up, there’s so much opportunity to quickly rack up a huge number of followers simply by being one of the early content creators on that platform. This was the case for the Paul brothers on Vine. After the fall of Vine, the Paul brothers were able to migrate their Vine fans over to YouTube.</p><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Know Your Audience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Jake has a very good understanding of who his audience is. He knows that his audience is young. By knowing the age group that the majority of his audience falls under, Jake is then able to tailor his content in a way that captures his audience’s attention most effectively. Through high-energy prank videos and daring stunts, Jake is able to supply his audience with the content that they want. As a YouTuber, you can get an idea of who your main audience is by accessing your channel’s analytics.</p><p><strong>Commitment To Consistent Delivery of Audience-Centered Content</strong></p><p>Jake made a serious commitment to delivering audience-centered content.

And it’s to be expected because Youtubers have been making content for way longer than TickTokers.</p><p>For example, MrBeast posted his first video on YouTube in 2012, and it has been about 10 years since he created his content.</p><p><strong>Are Highest-Paid YouTube Stars Always Trending?</strong></p><p>Since the highest-paid YouTubers make so much money, you may think they are always “Trending” on YouTube.</p><p>Sorry to pop your bubble, but they are not.</p><p>The highest-paid YouTubers may have a ton of subscribers, but being in “Trending” is different.</p><p>The most important reason is that the “Trending” part of YouTube shows popular videos in the specific area of the users, so it varies depending upon the user’s location.</p><h2 id="Final-Words-1"><a href="#Final-Words-1"

Your outro, or end screen, on YouTube is your last chance to keep viewers on your channel. This can help you increase your channel’s watch time and get your videos ranked higher in search results.</p><p>Here are 6 outro maker sites where you can get outros and end cards.

Outro Maker"></a>1. Outro Maker</h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>Outro Maker provides interactive, animated, end screens for YouTube videos at a low monthly cost.</em></p><p>On Outro Maker’s home page there’s a testimonials section featuring well-known YouTubers like Kandee Johnson. They’ve definitely got the social proof to back up their claims about ease and quality.</p><p>Outro Maker is a paid service ($3 per month for the basic package) and the biggest issue facing it is that a lot of the features it charges for have become free features of YouTube’s own end screen tool. You get access to templates and a template maker with Outro Maker, though, and that may be the important thing for you.</p><h4 id="2-Biteable"><a href="#2-Biteable" class="headerlink" title="2. Biteable"></a>2. Biteable</h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>Biteable skews more towards intros than outros, but makes up for it by being free.</em></p><p>Biteable has free video templates for YouTube intros and outros. You can use one of their pre-built options, or you can customize one of their video styles with your own logo, colors, and music.</p><p>This site definitely skews more towards intros than outros and they don’t really provide end screen cards. It would be up to you to choose a video style and customize it to make it work for your purpose, which shouldn’t be too much of a burden since the site is free.</p><h4 id="3-Tube-Arsenal"><a href="#3-Tube-Arsenal" class="headerlink" title="3. Tube Arsenal"></a>3. Tube Arsenal</h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>Tube Arsenal allows you to customize your intro on the site and download it for about $10.</em></p><p>Tube Arsenal has animated outro templates&#x2F;end screen cards as well as an on-site clip editor you can use to customize them with your channel’s colors&#x2F;logo&#x2F;images. They have template cards with slots for videos&#x2F;playlists as well as logos and subscribe buttons.</p><p>Tube Arsenal’s outros tend to cost $9 for 720p and $11 for 1080p. Some of their options include stylized ‘reveals’ of the ‘next video’ slots (i.e. they appear bit-by-bit from left to right) which will not be smoothly compatible with YouTube’s end screen tool (where the video previews will simply pop up).</p><h4 id="4-Renderforest"><a href="#4-Renderforest" class="headerlink" title="4. Renderforest"></a>4. Renderforest</h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>Render Forest lets you download intros with 3D text for $20, and you can also use them as outros.</em></p><p>Render Forest is an intro maker that can also work as an outro maker (their templates aren’t set up like end screens). They have a lot of 3D options, which is something only a few other outro makers can offer, and they have been used by a lot of major brands.</p><p>One drawback of Renderforest is that it is significantly more expensive than other services on this list. It will cost you $20 for a 720p clip.</p><h4 id="5-Panzoid"><a href="#5-Panzoid" class="headerlink" title="5. Panzoid"></a>5. Panzoid</h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>Panzoid is a completely free service where you can get high-quality outros with 3D text.</em></p><p>Panzoid is a community-driven site where creators make templates for intros and outros and post them for other creators to customize and download for free. There are a lot of high-quality clips on Panzoid, and most of what you find is 3D (a major perk).</p><h4 id="6-Intro-Cave"><a href="#6-Intro-Cave" class="headerlink" title="6. Intro Cave"></a>6. Intro Cave</h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>It costs $5 for a customized clip at Intro Cave.</em></p><p>As the name suggests, Intro Cave has a focus on intro videos. However, you can still use their customization system as an outro maker.</p><p>Although things do go on sale, they tend to charge $5 for a 720p clip.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://vapordna.pxf.io/c/5597632/1496243/17238" target="_top" id="1496243"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17238-1496243"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1221"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1496243/17238"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="YouTube-Outro-Maker-Alternative-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#YouTube-Outro-Maker-Alternative-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Outro Maker Alternative- Wondershare Filmora"></a>YouTube Outro Maker Alternative- Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Wondershare Filmora is a great video editor for all creators.

There are thousands of webinar software products and online platforms, but most of them are quite expensive and they require you to have a considerable amount of experience with the process of setting up and recording webinars.</p><p>An alternative solution is available if your budget is tight, but you’d still like to produce a great webinar. We are going to take you through all the steps you’ll need to take if you’d like to host a webinar for free and help you spread the word about the products and services you’re offering.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                > Secure Download</p><h2 id="Hosting-a-Webinar-for-Free"><a href="#Hosting-a-Webinar-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Hosting a Webinar for Free"></a>Hosting a Webinar for Free</h2><p>The world’s largest video sharing platform also features broadcasting options that enable its users to schedule events and thus host webinars free of charge. Previously known as the Google Hangouts on Air, the YouTube Live feature is fairly simple to set up, but before you start your first webinar you will need to choose a landing page and a chatbox. If you already have a website you can simply copy and paste the embed link and create a landing page for your webinar, or you can use landing pages software products such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.leadpages.net/" >LeadPages <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://unbounce.com/" >Unbounce <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you don’t have your own online domain. For setting up chatboxes for your webinars we recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://chatroll.com/" >Chatroll <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.rumbletalk.com/" >RumbleTalk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> platforms, although you’ll have to pay a fee if you choose to chat with your audience using these computer programs. So here’s how you can host your first webinar on YouTube for free.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Create-a-YouTube-Event"><a href="#Step-1-Create-a-YouTube-Event" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Create a YouTube Event"></a>Step 1. Create a YouTube Event</h4><p>If you don’t already have an account on YouTube, you’ll have to create one before you can schedule your first live event. After making sure that you are logged in to your YouTube account head over to the Creator Studio, and click on the Live Streaming tab. Select the New Live Event option and proceed to insert the basic information about the event such as the title, date when the event should take place, tags or a short description of the webinar you’re planning.</p><p>The Advanced Settings tab will enable you the access to options that will allow you to assign the license and the owner of the webinar. You can also choose the language, set the location or select the category of the event.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Copy-the-Embed-Code-and-Paste-it-To-Your-Webinar’s-Landing-Page"><a href="#Step-2-Copy-the-Embed-Code-and-Paste-it-To-Your-Webinar’s-Landing-Page" class="headerlink" title="Step 2. Copy the Embed Code and Paste it To Your Webinar’s Landing Page"></a>Step 2. Copy the Embed Code and Paste it To Your Webinar’s Landing Page</h4><p>When you adjust all the settings for your upcoming event, you should click on the Share button. This action will grant you access to the video’s embed link, so you can just copy it to your website, or to the landing page you’ve created with the appropriate software.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Add-the-Chatbox-to-The-Webinar’s-Landing-Page"><a href="#Step-3-Add-the-Chatbox-to-The-Webinar’s-Landing-Page" class="headerlink" title="Step 3. Add the Chatbox to The Webinar’s Landing Page"></a>Step 3. Add the Chatbox to The Webinar’s Landing Page</h4><p>Communicating with the audience during the webinar is important, and for that reason, embedding the chatbox link on the webinar’s landing page is a crucial step that will allow you to interact with the participants of your webinar. Chatbox platforms for live events such as <a class="link"   href="https://chatroll.com/" >Chatroll <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or RumbleTalk offer amazing features, but they cannot be used for free, which means that you’ll have to invest a certain amount of money in order to include a chatbox in your webinar.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Publish-the-Webinar’s-Landing-Page-and-Get-the-URL"><a href="#Step-4-Publish-the-Webinar’s-Landing-Page-and-Get-the-URL" class="headerlink" title="Step 4. Publish the Webinar’s Landing Page and Get the URL"></a>Step 4. Publish the Webinar’s Landing Page and Get the URL</h4><p>Making the event public a week or a few days before it takes place will provide you with enough time to promote it. Include the webinar’s landing page URL in the promotional social media posts and make sure to send out invites for your webinar to your friends and colleagues. Email marketing methods can help you get a larger number of attendees, which is the reason why investing time in the promotion of your webinar can prove to be extremely beneficial.</p><h4 id="Step-5-Start-your-Webinar"><a href="#Step-5-Start-your-Webinar" class="headerlink" title="Step 5. Start your Webinar"></a>Step 5. Start your Webinar</h4><p>Hit the Go Live Now button, when you are ready to start your first webinar and enjoy sharing your skills and knowledge with your audience. Even though YouTube offers a simple way to host webinars for free, it lacks the advanced options that enable you to use the prerecorded footage, keep track of the webinar’s analytics or create virtual whiteboards and polls.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >10 Best Free Video Hosting Sites for Private&#x2F;Business Online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068407/7443" target="_top" id="2068407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068407"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Enhance-Your-Video-with-These-Premium-Free-Audio-Stores"><a href="#Enhance-Your-Video-with-These-Premium-Free-Audio-Stores" class="headerlink" title="Enhance Your Video with These Premium, Free Audio Stores"></a>Enhance Your Video with These Premium, Free Audio Stores</h2><h1 id="15-Best-Sites-to-Find-Download-Royalty-Free-Music-for-YouTube"><a href="#15-Best-Sites-to-Find-Download-Royalty-Free-Music-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="15 Best Sites to Find &amp; Download Royalty-Free Music for YouTube"></a>15 Best Sites to Find &amp; Download Royalty-Free Music for YouTube</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                                     ></p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett"><a href="#Richard-Bennett" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>Choosing great royalty-free music for your YouTube videos will help put your audience in the right frame of mind, cover up flaws in your background audio, and help viewers feel more engaged with your content.</p><p>YouTube provides a free audio library, but since a lot of creators use it everyone’s videos can start to sound the same.

All of the music on this site is free.</p><p>One of the first things you’ll see when you arrive on Audiionautix is a ‘YouTube Friendly’ button. They know that most people browsing their music library are looking for songs for YouTube videos, and that want you to know their music is safe from copyright claims.</p><p>All of the music in the Audionautix collection was created by one man, Jason Shaw, but there’s still a huge variety of tracks.</p><p>On the front page of Audionautix, there are three selections you can make to start your music search – genre, mood, and tempo. Genres range from hard rock to bluegrass to techno (there are 28 genres in total), and the moods include things like ‘uplifting’, ‘evil’, and ‘bouncy’ (there are 37 of those). The tempos are fast, medium, and slow. So, if you want a medium-tempo acoustic song with a calming mood, you can easily find all of the songs that meet those qualifications.</p><p>Not every combination will deliver results, so it can be easier to just choose two of the three search parameters.</p><h4 id="2-Bensound"><a href="#2-Bensound" class="headerlink" title="2.

You’ll need to listen to a song to know if you want it, but the descriptions are a fast way to figure out if you don’t want something. For example, ‘A New Beginning’ could be anything based on that title, but the description lets you know it’s ‘punk rock’ with an ‘epic&#x2F;achievement’ feeling.</p><p>You can narrow down the music you are shown by choosing a genre from the menu near the top of your page (there are 8 genres including cinematic, electronica, and corporate&#x2F;pop).

You may chop off the beginning, middle, or ending of your movie on a computer. It is not necessary to re-upload a video to cut it. The video’s URL, view counts, and comments will remain unchanged. This functionality is only accessible for less than 6 hours long videos.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between cut and trim in video editing?</strong></p><p>Cutting is the process of separating pieces of a clip. You can reuse these portions in another video or delete them entirely. On the other hand, trimming is the process of eliminating or expanding the duration of a video clip’s front or tail regions in video editing.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeacheu.sjv.io/c/5597632/1996818/23722" target="_top" id="1996818"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23722-1996818"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1996818/23722"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Numerous programs will swiftly upload and trim your tiny movies, ideal for folks who make YouTube videos.

I won’t get into all of it, but here are some tips that you should always keep in mind.</p><p>- <strong>Less is more</strong>: Don’t clutter your icons, thumbnails, or banner.</p><p>- <strong>Have a single focus</strong>: A channel and a video can have a lot of different topics, but the image can’t show everything a video can. Pick one important area and highlight that in the image.</p><p>- <strong>Quality matters</strong>: Your audience is savvier than ever. If they see a pixelated image, they will judge your channel poorly. That’s bad branding. Always use high-quality pictures.</p><p>- <strong>Make sure the color pops and the text is visible:</strong> Use eye-catching colors and visible text. This is a billboard, you have milliseconds to get people’s attention as they scroll past.</p><p>Want more resources for creating your channel’s visual elements? Yes?

Choosing A Potential Partner"></a>1. Choosing A Potential Partner</h2><p>Before you think about how you’re going to approach someone you need to decide who you want to approach.</p><p>A lot of people automatically want to approach their YouTube hero, and that can be a mistake. Liking your partner’s videos is a must – why would you want to refer your subscribers to someone whose channel you wouldn’t watch yourself? – but it can be really hard to get someone with a significantly bigger channel than yours to work with you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choosing-potential-collab-partner.jpg"                      alt="Choosing A Potential Partner"                ></p><p><em>Will Kitty get to collab with the big dog?</em></p><p>Larger YouTubers get a lot of collab requests, and they are really busy with their own channels. Even if they love your content, it can be hard to justify taking time away from working on their own channel to do videos that won’t help them grow too.</p><p>Collaborating with someone your own size means you both stand to gain equally in channel growth. Instead of approaching someone you love that’s huge, try finding someone you like just as much whose sub count is similar to yours.</p><p>There are exceptions to this, of course. The team at <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDVPcEbVLQgLZX0Rt6jo34A" >Mr.Kate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> managed to work with YouTubers who had millions of subs while they were still under 1 million. They got these high profile collabs because they had something additional to offer that made up for the subscriber gap – they were redesigning the apartments, offices, or studios of the YouTubers they did the collabs with. If you want to work with someone bigger than you, think about what you might be able to offer them in place of new subscribers.</p><p><em>Mr.Kate makes over **<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAoMPWcQKA%5F9Af5YhWdrZgw?sub_confirmation=1" >MyLifeAsEva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>**’s bedroom.</em></p><p>Also, try to find someone whose channel has something in common with yours thematically so you know your subscribers will be interested in them. They don’t have to do exactly what you do, but your topics should be related. For example: if you do quirky video game reviews and they do quirky movie reviews, you could team up to review a movie based on a game. That would make sense. But if you quirky video game reviews and they review do very serious ice cream reviews, that’ll make a lot less sense.</p><p>A good way to find potentially collab partners is to look at your list of subscribers. You already know everyone there likes your channel!</p><h2 id="2-How-to-contact-a-partner"><a href="#2-How-to-contact-a-partner" class="headerlink" title="2. How to contact a partner"></a>2. How to contact a partner</h2><p>Sometimes people leave contact info in their video descriptions, but it might be easier to go to the <strong>About</strong> tab on their channel page and check for an email address. Look for a field that says <strong>for business inquiries</strong>, click on <strong>view email address</strong>, and use the CAPTCHA that appears to prove you aren’t a robot.</p><p>Reaching out more casually through Twitter DMs, YouTube comments, or Facebook is good too, but you should use those platforms more to build a relationship that could lead to a collab. If someone had never commented on a video of yours before and then commented once just to ask you to collab it’d be hard to believe they were really interested in your channel.</p><h2 id="3-Popular-Types-of-Collab-Videos"><a href="#3-Popular-Types-of-Collab-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Popular Types of Collab Videos"></a>3. Popular Types of Collab Videos</h2><p>_ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7afFvLLvTiWI97M0jaqgKQ"><strong>Gabrielle</strong></a> talks about different types of collabs and how well they work._</p><p>In most cases when you do a collab, you’ll each want to have content to post to your own channels (unless you’re doing some type of interview). You don’t want to put a lot of effort into a video that won’t end up being ‘yours’. Here are a few different ways to collaborate:</p><h4 id="1-Shout-outs"><a href="#1-Shout-outs" class="headerlink" title="#1. Shout outs"></a>#1. Shout outs</h4><p>In this type of collab all you do is mention each other and, usually, use YouTube cards to link to each other’s channels. You make a video that is completely yours, and at some point in it you talk about your partner’s channel and why you like it. To make things fair, you should discuss how long the mentions will be and where in the videos they will happen. It wouldn’t feel good to gush about how great someone is for a full minute near the beginning of your video and have them spend two seconds mentioning you near the end of theirs.</p><p>I personally don’t check people out just because someone I like mentions them, so this might not be the best way to go if you’re hoping to bring in new subscribers. It is the easiest kind of collab to do, though.</p><h4 id="2-Guest-spots"><a href="#2-Guest-spots" class="headerlink" title="2. Guest spots"></a>2. Guest spots</h4><p>This is my favorite kind of collab to watch, because each YouTuber has sole creative control over the video that goes on their channel. Instead of trying to blend your styles together, you each make videos that reflect your own personal styles.</p><p>For your video, you have the other vlogger on as a guest. In the video you do the same kinds of things your fans like watching you do, and you include the other person. If they’re alright with it, it can be fun to draw them a bit outside their comfort zone. If you like to dance on your channel, and they never dance on theirs, ask them to dance with you!</p><p><em><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9VX0KXNH20x9MCH3xGjisg" >Matthias <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> gets <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NateWantsToBattle" >NateWantsToBattle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> – who does song parodies on his channel – to make balloon animals.</em></p><p>Turnabout is fair play, of course, so be prepared to step a bit outside of your own comfort zone when you appear as a guest in one of their videos.</p><p>Alternatively, you could just introduce your guest and then let them take over and then do the same thing in reverse on their channel.</p><h4 id="3-Long-distance-collabs"><a href="#3-Long-distance-collabs" class="headerlink" title="3. Long distance collabs"></a>3. Long distance collabs</h4><p><em><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx-S6eBuL9SlwNZTHI6P9Bg" >Lauren <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> is in Toronto and <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmiE7g4J3QXBwPUybbRdioQ" >Aja <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> is in LA, but that doesn’t mean they can’t cook together! Also: Lauren’s channel is about food and Aja’s is about healthy living – they aren’t exactly the same, but they’re related enough that the collab makes sense.</em></p><p>Sometimes you really want to work together, but geography just won’t bend to your wills. That doesn’t mean you can’t collab. You can always send each other some footage to cut to and make videos together that way. Or, you can do a Google Hangout or Skype chat and record it.</p><h2 id="4-Getting-the-Most-Out-of-Your-Collaborations"><a href="#4-Getting-the-Most-Out-of-Your-Collaborations" class="headerlink" title="4. Getting the Most Out of Your Collaborations"></a>4. Getting the Most Out of Your Collaborations</h2><p>Usually, you have two reasons for wanting to do a collab; having fun with another YouTuber, and growing your channel. The collab exposes you to their subscribers, who will hopefully decide they like you and subscribe to you too. There are ways of increasing the odds of this happening.</p><p>Commenting on each other’s videos, and responding to viewer comments, is one of the best. It will help you seem more like a person who is being introduced than a guest star in a video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/getting-most-out-of-collaborations.jpg"                      alt="Getting the Most Out of Your Collaborations"                ></p><p><em>Kitty got the collab!

When you join the affiliate program of an online store they will allow you to create special links, called affiliate links, to products listed there. You post these affiliate links in the descriptions of your video reviews and, if viewers choose to click on those links and buy the products, you will earn a sales commission. Here are some stores with great affiliate programs:</p><h4 id="1-JVZoo"><a href="#1-JVZoo" class="headerlink" title="1. JVZoo"></a>1. JVZoo</h4><p>You can find high end products for about $5 to $10. Budgeting will be important if you plan on purchasing products to review instead of only reviewing products you already own (you should try to review items you already have as much as possible).</p><h4 id="2-Click-Bank"><a href="#2-Click-Bank" class="headerlink" title="2. Click Bank"></a>2. Click Bank</h4><p>You can find a wide range of interesting products here, and you can earn as much as 75% on sales commissions if you provide your viewers with an affiliate link.</p><h4 id="3-Warrior-Plus"><a href="#3-Warrior-Plus" class="headerlink" title="3. Warrior Plus"></a>3. Warrior Plus</h4><p>This is a highly renowned affiliate program. It very similar to JVZoo.</p><h4 id="4-Amazon"><a href="#4-Amazon" class="headerlink" title="4. Amazon"></a>4. Amazon</h4><p>It doesn’t get any better than Amazon. You can find just about anything.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453720/17020" target="_top" id="1453720"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453720"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453720/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Part-2-Getting-Products-for-Free"><a href="#Part-2-Getting-Products-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2:  Getting Products for Free"></a>Part 2:  Getting Products for Free</h3><p>Once you’ve built up authority as a reviewer, brands will start giving you free stuff to review. Until then, you can buy the products yourself or review products which you already own. It will be a lot cheaper to review things you already have, or which you were already planning to buy, than to buy products for the purpose of reviewing them. Your reviews will also be more detailed and useful when they are on products you are especially familiar with.</p><p>Once you start building a following, brands will come to you and it will be your choice whether you want to review the things they send you. Until then, try to promote&#x2F;review products you already have opinions on.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turbotech.pxf.io/c/5597632/1450763/17212" target="_top" id="1450763"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17212-1450763"                      border="0" alt="" width="2560" height="1440"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1450763/17212"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Part-3-Filming-the-Video"><a href="#Part-3-Filming-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 3:  Filming the Video"></a>Part 3:  Filming the Video</h3><p>Be completely honest. People are going to know when you are trying to sell something. Fake reviewers are all over the place, and they are easily spotted.</p><p>That does not mean you shouldn’t make money through affiliate links, or accept free products to review. So long as you are honest in your opinions, and open with your viewers about any relationships you have with brands, you are not ‘selling out’.</p><p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p><p>It takes time to earn any money reviewing products on YouTube.

Joining the YPP, and making sure your YouTube channel complies with YouTube’s rules and policies, is the more complicated aspect.</p><p>Those advertising on YouTube want to avoid being linked to low-quality content. Therefore, YouTube Partner Program members are encouraged to create unique, valuable videos.</p><p>When you upload content to YouTube, you’ll need to keep these things in mind.

To do so, it’s essential to provide something unique and different to the viewer. Without providing them the content they are looking for, it is impossible to grow your channel and reach. Once your content is ready and you are getting many views, it is essential to make these potential viewers your permanent viewers. The animated subscribe button will help you achieve this goal.

In my case, I am trying to make an animated subscribe button of 5 seconds.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button1.png"                      alt="subscribe-button1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Lock this track by clicking on the lock icon to work on subscribe animation without disturbing the background easily.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button2.png"                      alt="subscribe-button2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://newchic.sjv.io/c/5597632/1659704/14420" target="_top" id="1659704"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14420-1659704"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1659704/14420"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now it’s time to design the subscribe png gif.

Go to the Title and select any style that you like. “Basic 6” will work perfectly fine for this purpose. Drag and drop it into the timeline above all tracks.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button5.png"                      alt="subscribe-button5"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Double click on the Title on the timeline and edit it with “Subscribe” and place it under the red rectangle and click OK.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button6.png"                      alt="subscribe-button6"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> We have put a cursor that can click on the animated subscribe button. You can use Google Search to find a transparent cursor. Make sure to save it in png format. Download it and import it into Filmora.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button7.png"                      alt="subscribe-button7"                ></p><p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Drag and drop the cursor into the timeline and place it above all the other three tracks to make it prominent. Adjust the size of the cursor place it on the Subscribe button where you want it to appear.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button8.png"                      alt="subscribe-button8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Now, it’s time to animate the design using keyframes. First of all, let’s animate the red rectangle. Double click on the red color on the timeline. Go to the ‘Animation’ tab and then click ‘Customize.’ Move to the 1 second in the timeline and click ‘Add.’<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button9.png"                      alt="subscribe-button9"                ></p><p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Now go back to the beginning in the timeline and adjust the scale to 0%.

Double click on the text in the timeline and click ‘ADVANCED.’<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button11.png"                      alt="subscribe-button11"                ></p><p><strong>Step 12:</strong> In this Advance text editor, go to the ‘Animation’ tab and select any animation that you like. On the timeline under the preview screen, adjusts the dark areas according to the time you set on the rectangle, which was 1 second. We want the text to appear on the screen in 1 second, like the rectangle. Also, adjust the ending time when you want the text to disappear again. We have set it on 4 seconds. Which means it will start to fade after 4 seconds.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button12.png"                      alt="subscribe-button12"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turbotech.pxf.io/c/5597632/1450763/17212" target="_top" id="1450763"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17212-1450763"                      border="0" alt="" width="2560" height="1440"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1450763/17212"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Now, to animate the mouse cursor, we will use the same process we used for a rectangle that is key framing. Double click on the cursor track on the timeline and move the time on your timeline to a point when you want the cursor to appear. Now add a key frame by clicking ‘Add’.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button13.png"                      alt="subscribe-button13"                ></p><p><strong>Step 14:</strong> Now jump back to a point in your timeline, when the cursor will start appearing from outside the screen. Move the cursor outside the screen from where you want it to start moving toward the subscribe animation.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button14.png"                      alt="subscribe-button14"                ></p><p><strong>Step 15:</strong> To animate the click of the cursor, move ahead a little bit into your timeline and scale down the cursor to around 70%. Move it a little further and scale it up to 100%.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button15.png"                      alt="subscribe-button15"                ></p><p><strong>Step 16:</strong> You can add the sound of mouse click to make it more realistic. You can find this sound anywhere on the internet. Download it and import it into Filmora.

Move forward into the time to the end, at around 4 seconds. Double click on the red button in the timeline and add a key frame at its actual scale.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button17.png"                      alt="subscribe-button17"                ></p><p><strong>Step 18:</strong> After that, move further in the timeline to the end and make its scale 0.

Finally, export the entire project to your preferred output format as explained in <strong>Step 4</strong>.</p><p>As explained before, Wondeshare Filmora makes the entire process of creating and adding <strong>bounce text</strong> effect pretty simple. With all the pre-build templates, and the versatility of the options that can be used to customize those presets, you can come up with the effects that are usually obtained when you start generating them from the scratch.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h2 id="Method-2-Generate-Animated-Bouncing-Texts-Online"><a href="#Method-2-Generate-Animated-Bouncing-Texts-Online" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Generate Animated Bouncing Texts Online"></a>Method 2: Generate Animated Bouncing Texts Online</h2><p>If you don’t want any heavy and resource-intensive app on your PC merely for some special text effects, you can try any of the online solutions instead.
