Can someone tell me how to work on a sports video?”</em></p><p>As I read this query posted on a popular online forum, I realized that so many people out there find it hard to create a sports video. Well, unlike a standard video, working on a sports highlight video can be tough. This is because it needs a lot of editing and we need to handpick the right moments from hours of footage. Though, if you use the right tools, then you can easily work on highlight videos like a pro. In this guide, I will let you know how to create sports videos in a step by step manner.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Why is a sports highlight video and why important?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Highlight Video vs. Skills Video</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Use Excellent Video Editor to Make a Sports Highlight Video</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Create a Sports Highlight Video?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Expert Tips for Creating Highlight Videos</a></li></ul><h2 id="Why-is-a-sports-highlight-video-and-why-important"><a href="#Why-is-a-sports-highlight-video-and-why-important" class="headerlink" title="Why is a sports highlight video and why important?"></a>Why is a sports highlight video and why important?</h2><p>As the name suggests, a highlight video basically includes all the vital events of a game in a short duration of time. You can include the details of some players at the start or focus on a particular player as well. Besides that, a sports highlight video would have fast-forward, slow motion, and frozen clips to skip or focus on certain details.</p><p>A lot of times, people don’t have the time to watch the entire game, which can span for a couple of hours. Therefore, they can watch a sports highlight video that would include all the major events of the game and will let them enjoy their thrill in a few moments.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sports-highlight-video.jpg"                      alt="Sports Highlight Video"                ></p><p>Besides that, if you are applying for a college&#x2F;academy or just want to showcase your skills, then you can consider making a sports video of an impressive game of yours. You can simply showcase a player and try to highlight their skills in the video.</p><h2 id="Highlight-Videos-vs-Skills-Videos-the-Major-Differences"><a href="#Highlight-Videos-vs-Skills-Videos-the-Major-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Highlight Videos vs. Skills Videos: the Major Differences"></a>Highlight Videos vs. Skills Videos: the Major Differences</h2><p>While making a sports video, you might encounter two different types of content – a highlight video and a skills video. As I have mentioned above, a sports highlight video would include the shots of an actual game. You can either focus on the event of a single game or include clips from multiple games that were played in a genuine setup. If you want, you can highlight a particular player while making the video as well.</p><p>On the other hand, a skills video is mostly made to demonstrate the skills of a player and is not focused on the game. In fact, most of the skills videos are made outside of a real game setting. For instance, if you have mastered a skill or would like to demonstrate your game-related actions, then you can make a skills video. Some of these videos are also tutorial game-plays to teach others about a particular skill that they can master.</p><h2 id="Use-Excellent-Video-Editor-to-Make-a-Sports-Highlight-Video"><a href="#Use-Excellent-Video-Editor-to-Make-a-Sports-Highlight-Video" class="headerlink" title="Use Excellent Video Editor to Make a Sports Highlight Video"></a>Use Excellent Video Editor to Make a Sports Highlight Video</h2><p>If you want to come up with engaging and visually appealing highlight videos, then consider using a versatile video editor like <strong>Filmora</strong>. Equipped with several video editing tools, it will let you create a sports highlight video in no time. Since the tool has so many features, you can save your time in editing and come up with a new sports video in minutes.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><ul><li>Filmora is extremely easy to use and runs on all the leading Windows and macOS versions without any issue.</li><li>Using its inbuilt tools, you can clip out the most important events from a sports video or include them in your highlights.</li><li>There are also features to change the motion and pace of the video (like fast forward or slow motion).</li><li>You can also focus on any athlete and freeze a frame on a particular skill or action.</li><li>Besides that, you can also add voiceovers in your sports highlight video, add media layers, use its inbuilt transitions, and fine-tune the overall aesthetics of your videos.</li><li>There are also tons of filters and presets in Filmora that you can use to save your time in editing.

Firstly, you can install Filmora on your Windows or Mac by visiting its website and have the footage you wish to edit. Now, you can just follow these steps to work on your next sports highlight video.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg" >Filmstock Stock Media Library <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-sports?spm=rs.filmora_web&source_channel=seo_article" >https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-sports?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&amp;source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><h4 id="Step-1-Add-a-video-to-Filmora"><a href="#Step-1-Add-a-video-to-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Add a video to Filmora"></a>Step 1: Add a video to Filmora</h4><p>To start with, just launch Filmora on your computer and add the video that you wish to work on. You can just drag and drop the video to its interface or go to its Menu &gt; File &gt; Import Media to browse and load the file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/import-media-file-to-filmora-1.jpg"                      alt="Import Media File"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Edit-the-Sports-Video"><a href="#Step-2-Edit-the-Sports-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Edit the Sports Video"></a>Step 2: Edit the Sports Video</h4><p>In order to create a sports highlight video, the first thing that people do is trim any unwanted part. Once the video is loaded, you can view it on the timeline of the interface. Now, go to the timeline and get the trim tool to manually select the part of the video you wish to trim. After selecting the desired fragment, you can trim the clip or just delete it by clicking on their respective icons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-sports-video-1.jpg"                      alt="Edit Sports Video"                ></p><p>In the same way, you can also split your video and make other changes in it. You can also include multiple videos together and include them in your timeline as well.</p><p>If you are including multiple videos, then make sure they have the same dimensions and aspect ratio. For this, you can select the video, right-click on the timeline, and click on the crop icon. Now, select the same aspect ratio for the entire video to keep it uniform.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-sports-video-2.jpg"                      alt="Edit Sports Video"                ></p><p>Most of the game highlights that we see have different speeds for various sections. That is, some actions would be fast-forwarded while some would be in slow motion. To apply this, simply select the section in the timeline, right-click, and go to the Speed and Duration settings. This will open a dedicated interface from where you can change the speed of the sports video.</p><p>Apart from manually setting the speed, you can also take the assistance of the custom speed options that are available in the timeline tools.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-sports-video-3.jpg"                      alt="Edit Sports Video"                ></p><h4 id="Step-3-Make-Advanced-Edits-in-your-Sports-Video"><a href="#Step-3-Make-Advanced-Edits-in-your-Sports-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Make Advanced Edits in your Sports Video"></a>Step 3: Make Advanced Edits in your Sports Video</h4><p>With the user-friendly interface of Filmora, you can do some basic edits and make a sports highlight video in minutes. Though, if you want to focus on some parts and make more changes, then you can use its advanced options as well.</p><p>For instance, in a highlight video, we often wish to freeze certain frames. To do this, just select a frame and use the “Freeze Frame” option from the timeline tools. You can even set the duration to freeze the selected frame.</p><p>If you have included clips from different videos, then you can apply all kinds of transitions from Filmora. In the end, you can go to its edit options and choose to close gaps as well.</p><p>To give your video a uniform and aesthetically pleasing appeal, you can also add different overlays and effects on it from Filmora’s library.</p><p>Lastly, make sure that you added sound or voiceover to your video. You can add a sound from its library or import any other music file to it. Since highlight videos mostly have voiceovers, you add the same by visiting the Record &gt; Record Voiceover option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-sports-video-4.jpg"                      alt="Edit Sports Video"                ></p><h4 id="Step-4-Export-your-video-in-the-desired-format"><a href="#Step-4-Export-your-video-in-the-desired-format" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Export your video in the desired format"></a>Step 4: Export your video in the desired format</h4><p>That’s it! Once your sports highlight video is ready, you can export it in different formats. Just go to the Export option and select the location to save the video and a preferred resolution. You can save your video in formats like MP4, WMV, AVI, FLV, MKV, and so on.</p><h2 id="Expert-Tips-for-Creating-Highlight-Videos"><a href="#Expert-Tips-for-Creating-Highlight-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Expert Tips for Creating Highlight Videos"></a>Expert Tips for Creating Highlight Videos</h2><p>As you can see, making a sports highlight video with a tool like Filmora is extremely easy. Although to be a pro and make better videos, you can consider the following tips:</p><h4 id="Keep-it-short"><a href="#Keep-it-short" class="headerlink" title="Keep it short"></a>Keep it short</h4><p>Make sure that you only include the highlights of the game in your video to keep it interesting. Your aim is to have a short and crisp video without any unwanted footage.</p><h4 id="Use-freeze-frames-and-slow-motion"><a href="#Use-freeze-frames-and-slow-motion" class="headerlink" title="Use freeze frames and slow motion"></a>Use freeze frames and slow motion</h4><p>Some games can be pretty fast-paced and the viewers might miss out on a few key details. To showcase them, you can freeze certain frames or apply slow motion.</p><h4 id="Include-other-details"><a href="#Include-other-details" class="headerlink" title="Include other details"></a>Include other details</h4><p>A sports highlight video can also be informative. You can include details about the players or the team at the start. Also, it is recommended to have sound or a voiceover in the background to narrate the events.</p><h4 id="Pick-the-best-clips"><a href="#Pick-the-best-clips" class="headerlink" title="Pick the best clips"></a>Pick the best clips</h4><p>When you watch a game, make a note of the best moments that you know your viewers would enjoy. You can also focus on different skills that you found impressive and include them in your sports video.</p><p>I’m sure that after reading this guide, you would be able to come up with an impressive sports highlight video as well. Since you might need to make a lot of edits on a sports video, I would recommend using a diverse tool like Filmora. With the tons of editing options that it provides, you can easily create all sorts of highlight videos while saving your time and resources.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="The-Key-to-Success-Perfecting-Your-Online-YT-Presence"><a href="#The-Key-to-Success-Perfecting-Your-Online-YT-Presence" class="headerlink" title="The Key to Success: Perfecting Your Online YT Presence"></a>The Key to Success: Perfecting Your Online YT Presence</h2><h1 id="How-to-Edit-YouTube-Channel-Description"><a href="#How-to-Edit-YouTube-Channel-Description" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit YouTube Channel Description"></a>How to Edit YouTube Channel Description</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-light-up-your-screen-the-9-most-innovative-camgear-for-video-creators/"><u>[New] Light Up Your Screen  The 9 Most Innovative CamGear for Video Creators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-from-idea-to-internet-fame-becoming-a-vtuber/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  From Idea to Internet Fame  Becoming a VTuber?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-fearless-filming-mastering-your-first-10-clips-for-2024/"><u>[New] Fearless Filming  Mastering Your First 10 Clips for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-clubbing-essentials-top-rated-dj-template-vids/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Clubbing Essentials  Top-Rated DJ Template Vids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-essential-ios-video-editor-apps-top-10-best-to-know/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Essential iOS Video Editor Apps  Top 10 Best to Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-how-to-download-youtube-thumbnail-in-3-waysonlinewinmac-for-2024/"><u>[New] How to Download Youtube Thumbnail in 3 Ways [Online/Win/Mac] for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-financial-magnitude-in-mr-beasts-realm-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Financial Magnitude in Mr. Beast's Realm for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-your-roadmap-to-monetization-mastery-the-straightforward-strategy-for-analyzing-youtube-earnings/"><u>2024 Approved  Your Roadmap to Monetization Mastery  The Straightforward Strategy for Analyzing YouTube Earnings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/play-store-stuck-on-downloading-of-vivo-v29-7-ways-to-resolve-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Play Store Stuck on Downloading Of Vivo V29? 7 Ways to Resolve | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-newest-camstudio-capture-and-review-2023-update-for-2024/"><u>[New] Newest CamStudio Capture & Review  2023 Update for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/decoding-the-art-of-persuasive-tiktok-marketing-and-advertising/"><u>Decoding the Art of Persuasive TikTok Marketing & Advertising</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/bypassreset-galaxy-s21-fe-5g-2023-phone-screen-passcodepatternpin-by-drfone-android-unlock-android-unlock/"><u>Bypass/Reset Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) Phone Screen Passcode/Pattern/Pin</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-clear-up-audio-in-youtube-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>[Updated] Clear Up Audio in YouTube  A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/2024-approved-use-this-color-match-paint-technique-to-find-the-exact-shade-of-any-hue-you-have-in-mind-for-your-paint-project-match-the-paint-to-your-desire/"><u>2024 Approved Use This Color Match Paint Technique to Find the Exact Shade of Any Hue You Have in Mind for Your Paint Project.

One of the most important things you need to get out of the way is the business name.

Filmostocks is a great choice for all YouTubers who edit their videos with Filmora or other versions of this video editing software as well as Adobe After Effects.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="2-MotionDen-3"><a href="#2-MotionDen-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

Along with all this massive inflow, there are scenarios where the video content that you like or wanted to watch gets deleted for any reason. Either the uploading channel deleted the video, or YouTube sometimes deletes videos for violating any of the platform’s rules – showing the dismal message “We’re sorry, this video is no longer available”. You’ll be thinking it is probably impossible to access deleted YouTube videos that you wanted to watch so badly. Though it may be true to some extent, in reality, nothing gets deleted from the internet. To help you watch deleted YouTube videos, we’ll dive into the two most handy methods down below. So, let get started.</p><p>You might be interested in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Make a Playlist of Uploaded Videos and Others’ Video on YouTube&gt;&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos with a URL</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare FilmoraX</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title="["></a>[</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-with-a-URL"><a href="#Part-1-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-with-a-URL" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos with a URL"></a>Part 1: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos with a URL</h2><p>Internet Archive(known as the Wayback Machine) is a website archival system that has been collecting and cataloging websites since 1996. This means the system has effectively saved the site’s current layout and data. This enormous world archive of the Web’s past has amassed over 100 terabytes of storage with around 10 billion web pages.</p><p>On the archive.org website, you can find many of your favorite web site’s “snapshot” at a time in the past. For our case, we need to find and watch deleted YouTube videos, so for that, all we need is the link of the video, and we can most probably find it on archive.org. The steps for finding and restoring deleted YouTube videos are simple and as follows.</p><p>1. First of all, find the URL in your YouTube email, channel account if you’re searching for your uploaded video. You can find the link in browser history, in YouTube history, or you may have shared the link on social media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-video-from-youtube-history.jpg"                      alt="Find deleted YouTube videos from history"                ></p><p>If you want to watch a deleted YouTube video using the Wayback Machine, you must find the link to the video you want to access; without the URL, you won’t be able to access the deleted YouTube video.</p><p>2. Head over to the <a class="link"   href="https://archive.org/" >archive.org website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and paste the YouTube video URL in the search bar and press return.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-way-back-machine1.jpg"                      alt="open way back machine"                ></p><p>3. Once you find your video on the internet archive, you can see the details of the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-deleted-video2.jpg"                      alt="find deleted video"                ></p><p>4. You won’t be able to play the video directly, but you should be able to download it. Right, click the video to find the option to download the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-deleted-video3.jpg"                      alt="download deleted video"                ></p><p>This method works mostly as the Wayback machine is pretty active and regularly crawls the web to archive the sites. But sometimes, this method may not work and would require a more sophisticated way to watch deleted YouTube videos.</p><h2 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title="["></a>[</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-without-a-URL"><a href="#Part-2-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-without-a-URL" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL"></a>Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL</h2><p>But what if you don’t have a URL for the deleted YouTube video? The internet is a global village network. Everything on the internet is connected, and that connection makes it more useful for example, even though a YouTube video might be deleted, you can somehow access and watch the deleted YouTube videos without a URL because people always replicate videos and share them on other YouTube channels or social media platforms. To make sure you get to watch your favorite YouTube video again, we will dive into the vast internet and find the deleted YouTube videos.</p><p>This method can be a bit complicated and would require you to give full attention to find the video you want to watch that badly that you’ve landed on this article.</p><p>1. Open a new tab in your browser and go to the Google search bar. We’re going to employ a technique from the SEO expert’s toolbox – Google Search Operators.</p><p>2. In the search bar, type <strong>“site:<a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/" >www.youtube.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> + name Of TheVideo”</strong></p><p>3. This way Google will crawl all the name relevant videos only from the YouTube databases and move us closer to finding our deleted YouTube video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/goggle-crawl-url4.jpg"                      alt="google crawl url"                ></p><p>4. If you know the video was shared by someone on Facebook or any other social media platform, you can change the site URL in the search bar, replacing YouTube with Facebook, for example.</p><p>5. Once you find the video URL, you can simply go back to the first method that we discussed and paste the URL into the internet archive. The archive will give you the video and you can enjoy watching a deleted YouTube video.</p><p>Note: If you still cannot find the video using this method, I’m sorry to tell you the video may be completely deleted from the server, and you cannot access it anymore.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip—Make-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip—Make-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Want to make a YouTube video again? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a relatively lightweight and powerful platform you get an intuitive interface and the power to create wonderful, unique content.

Also, resizing your YouTube thumbnail will prevent you from getting the “file larger than 2MB error” which can cause your thumbnail to be discarded.</p><p>So, how can you use this technique?

Something that may have been surprising was the amount of equipment it takes to run a successful vlog. Besides your camera you need equipment for stabilizing it, for lighting your shots, and for recording better audio than your camera is capable of. If you still don’t know which camera to use, this article will tell you the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best cameras for YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Do not be overwhelmed! There are loads of affordable options for YouTube equipment. There are even some tricks you can use to get by without some pieces of equipment until you are ready to make the investment.</p><p>Here are examples of some of the best YouTube equipment. Watch for the ‘Free Option!’ at the bottom of every section!</p><h4 id="1-Stabilizers-for-YouTube"><a href="#1-Stabilizers-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="1. Stabilizers for YouTube"></a>1. Stabilizers for YouTube</h4><p><strong>Selfie Stick:</strong> A lot of vloggers like to record from their phones, and selfie sticks make great stabilizers. You can put one end on the ground and use your selfie stick similarly to a monopod. Selfie sticks are also very affordable. The Cazbe Selfie Stick is only about $40. If you want to be a bit more sophisticated about your smartphone video then you might consider the KumbaCam 3 Axis Smart Phone Stabilizer, which is described as a ‘selfie stick on steroids’. It is a pricier option at $350.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment01.jpg"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>Tripod:</strong> A tripod is what most people think of when they think of stabilizing their cameras. Tripods come in different weights and sizes, and there are even tripods specifically for smartphones. There is a wide range of pricing for tripods. Mid-range is about $50.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment02.JPG"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>Free Option! Any Available Surface:</strong> Kitchen tables. Desks. Park benches. Trees. Your friend’s shoulder, if you ask nicely. Anything you can rest your camera on top of can be used to record a steady video.</p><h4 id="2-Lighting-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#2-Lighting-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="2. Lighting for YouTube Videos"></a>2. Lighting for YouTube Videos</h4><p><strong>Softbox Lights:</strong> These are the kinds of lights that were probably used to take your school photos. They create soft, diffused, light and can be fairly affordable. The LimoStudio 700W Photography Softbox Lighting Kit is $167, and that is about the average.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment03.jpg"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>LED Panel Light:</strong> LED panels produce high quality light. Prices vary. The Aputure Amaran AL-528S LED Video Light costs $358 (with stand). There are also LED panel lights which can be mounted onto your camera, like the Julius Studio NEW 160 LED 160 Dimmable Ultra High Power Panel Light which costs $111.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment04.jpg"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>Free Option!

Audio Equipment for YouTube"></a>3. Audio Equipment for YouTube</h4><p><strong>Snoball:</strong> A Blue Snoball USB mic is an extremely affordable option at $60, although it does not have good range. You have to stay close to your computer if you use a Snoball.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment05.JPG"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>Shotgun:</strong> You can get a shotgun mic to attach to your camera at a fairly decent price. The RØDE Video Shotgun Mic is only $140. You will not be able to stray far from your camera as it works best when you are close to it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment06.JPG"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>MP3 Recorder:</strong> A very high quality voice recorder is one way to record great audio and still be able to move freely. The Roland R-05 WAVE&#x2F;MP3 Recorder is a great choice at $200.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment07.jpg"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p> <strong>LAV System:</strong> A lavalier, or lapel, mic system is a lot of vloggers’ favorite way to record dialogue because the mics are small and clip right on to your clothing. This is a more expensive option. The Sony LAV Wireless Mic System is $600.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment08.JPG"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p> <strong>Free Option! Audacity:</strong>  Audacity is free audio recording&#x2F;editing software that is popular with vloggers.

YouTube gamers are among some of the most popular vloggers on YouTube. To be a successful YouTube gamer you need have both gaming skills and a great vlogging presence.</p><p>Posting a cool gaming videos once in a while for your friends is fun, and if that is all you want to do then the first tip on this list should help you out. If you are hoping to build a popular YouTube channel centered on gaming then you will want to read further. Gaming vlogs are more than just hobbies for successful YouTube gamers. They put a lot of work into them.</p><p>The first thing you need to know about being a gaming vlogger is that gameplay footage is protected by copyright. Some game creators will allow for the use of this footage in gaming vlogs because it helps promote their games, but others see these videos as competition for their games. There will usually be information on the manufacturer’s website, often in the ‘Terms of Use’ section, which explains their policy. If you have questions about it, or want permission to use footage from a game you are not allowed to, you should ask. There are YouTube gamers posting videos of games the copyright does not allow them to who have gotten special permission, although this is more likely to be given if your channel is already popular.</p><hr><p>Looking for a good video editor for your gaming video? Wondershare Filmora is recommended. It is not just a video editor which allows you to cut, split, add text, apply background sound to your video clips, but also a screen recorder which helps you record videos from PC screem webcam, and voice over. What’s more, you can find lots of special effects for gaming in this software.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><hr><p>&lt;2&gt; Four tips for YouTube gamers:</p><h4 id="1-Equipment"><a href="#1-Equipment" class="headerlink" title="1. Equipment"></a>1. Equipment</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gamer-elgato.JPG"                      alt="gamer elgato"                ></p><p>For some types of vlogs, beauty vlogs for example, the camera is the most important piece of equipment. For a YouTube gamer the most important piece of equipment is a game recorder, such as the Elgato Game Capture featured above. The Elgato Game Capture costs about $150 online, which is a typical price for a quality game recorder. Most of the footage you record is going to be from inside your games, so a game recorder is a must. Nobody wants to watch footage recorded from a camera pointing at your tv screen.</p><p>You will need a camera if you want to record reaction videos, which you probably will if you are going to be playing horror games where your reactions enhance the viewing experience. You do not need to record a reaction video for every game you play, though. So, it is not necessary for you to pay upwards of $1000 on a DSLR for your gaming channel. A good webcam will do, or you could even use your phone’s camera.</p><p>Aside from your game play the most important thing you will be recording is audio. It is worth investing in an external microphone. Since you do not need to worry about the range of your microphone for a gaming vlog something like the Blue Snowball USB mic is a great choice. These cost about $50 online. LAV mics are also popular among vloggers because they can be clipped onto your shirt while you record. An entire Lavalier system can cost over $100, sometimes around $600, but it is less expensive to buy a single LAV mic that plugs into the audio jack of your phone or computer.</p><p>If you cannot afford to invest in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >an external microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> then you should download a free audio editing program called Audacity from <a class="link"   href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" >Audacityteam.org <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You can use Audacity to improve the quality of the sound you record using your computer or camera.</p><h4 id="2-Developing-Your-Voice"><a href="#2-Developing-Your-Voice" class="headerlink" title="2. Developing Your Voice"></a>2. Developing Your Voice</h4><p>The reason a lot of people will want to watch your gaming videos while they could be watching someone else’s is not because you are a great gamer. It is because you are a great entertainer. Your vlogging voice should be a lot like a DJ’s radio voice; clear, confident, and louder than you would ever be at the dinner table. People do not tend to actually talk in the same voice they vlog in and YouTube gamers are no exception.</p><p>Forcing yourself into a fake voice is awkward, though, and while your vlogging voice is something you will need to develop it should not be fake. Remember to speak up and focus on your games. Some of your best commentary will happen while you are completely absorbed in what you are doing. Talking while you game and sounding natural will not happen right away, but it will with practice. When you start getting comments on your videos keep that feedback in mind and try to work the kinds of things your viewers like into your gaming voiceovers more often.</p><h4 id="3-Time-Management"><a href="#3-Time-Management" class="headerlink" title="3. Time Management"></a>3. Time Management</h4><p>Recording a gaming video you are happy with takes time. Editing that video can also take up a lot of time, depending on the style of video you want to post. These are the time commitments that most people expect to have when starting a gaming channel, but they are not the only ones.</p><p>Initially, you will need to spend a lot of time thinking about what kind of gaming channel you want to run. Are you more focused on game reviews, or on comedy? You will also need to consider whether your target audience consists of serious gamers who are looking for something informative or casual gamers – perhaps even non-gamers – who just want to watch entertaining YouTube videos. The answers to these questions will lead you to building your brand, which can also be time consuming. You will need channel art – like an icon and a banner – as well as intro and outro sequences. Plan to think about and create these things early or you will end up getting busy and rushing through them.</p><p>The other things related to your gaming channel which will be taking up your time are: researching gaming trends, networking with other YouTube gamers, and promoting your channel. You need to plan out times for these activities, as well as time limits. These are the things that can eat up all of your personal time if you let them.</p><h4 id="4-Channel-Promotion"><a href="#4-Channel-Promotion" class="headerlink" title="4. Channel Promotion"></a>4. Channel Promotion</h4><p>In order to start getting more views and subscribers you will need to promote your channel. Part of this is having searchable video titles and descriptions, but you also need to get involved with the communities surrounding the games you are playing. These communities are more likely to want to watch your videos if you are a part of them.</p><p>Besides creating your own gaming videos you will need to watch other people’s and reach out to these gamers through comments. If you find another YouTube gamer with close to your same number of subscribers then you may even want to approach them about collaboration. This is one way you can promote your channel; by introducing yourself to the other gamer’s subscribers and allowing them to be introduced to yours. You will also need to put time into being active in gaming forums and communities in order to show people you know what you are doing and tell them about your channel.</p><p>You should not use the comments sections of other people’s videos, or gaming forums, just to promote your own channel. You can and should promote your channel through these mediums, it just cannot seem like self-interest is the only reason you are bothering. When you comment on another gamer’s video actually say something that gamer might want to respond to, not just ‘I did a video like this too, check it out!’. It is the same when you start getting involved with gaming forums. You need to participate in conversations and take an interest in people if you want them to take an interest in you and your work.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Hit-the-Bottom-Finding-Your-Best-Free-YouTube-Downloader-App-on-Android"><a href="#Hit-the-Bottom-Finding-Your-Best-Free-YouTube-Downloader-App-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Hit the Bottom - Finding Your Best Free YouTube Downloader App on Android"></a>Hit the Bottom - Finding Your Best Free YouTube Downloader App on Android</h2><h1 id="FREE-6-Best-YouTube-to-MP3-Downloader-for-Android"><a href="#FREE-6-Best-YouTube-to-MP3-Downloader-for-Android" class="headerlink" title="FREE 6 Best YouTube to MP3 Downloader for Android"></a>FREE 6 Best YouTube to MP3 Downloader for Android</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Ollie-Mattison"><a href="#Ollie-Mattison" class="headerlink" title="Ollie Mattison"></a>Ollie Mattison</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>You can now download your own YouTube videos directly on your Android phones, but what if you want to download the video and save it on MP3 music without spending money?

It might be the most important, but it’s not the only important element. The visuals are also essential. There are several reasons why the right DJ template video download can significantly improve your set.</p><p>Read below and you’ll open your eyes to how a simple template and a bit of video editing can change your whole career as a DJ.</p><p><strong>YouTube Video Background</strong> Creating realistic video scenes at your will is easy to complete with Filmora green screen removal.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Create Video Backgrounds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Create Video Backgroundss <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn Green Screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="What-Is-a-DJ-Template-Video-Download"><a href="#What-Is-a-DJ-Template-Video-Download" class="headerlink" title="What Is a DJ Template Video Download?"></a>What Is a DJ Template Video Download?</h2><p>DJ template video downloads are basically video templates with pre-recorded clips and effect presets that sync with your music. So, regardless of what tempo, genre, or style your DJ set is, this template will sync with it perfectly and make everything look more professional, modern, funky, or whatever result you prefer.</p><p>There are three main characteristics of DJ template videos, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Pre-Designed Visuals:</strong> These templates are ready-made visuals that can be used as-is or customized further. They range from abstract patterns and pulsating geometries to thematic scenes and rhythmic animations.</li><li><strong>Customizable Elements:</strong> You can personally customize many of these templates. This might include integrating logos and text or tweaking the color scheme to match the event’s theme.</li><li><strong>Format and Compatibility:</strong> They are usually available in formats compatible with common VJing and DJing software, ensuring seamless integration into the DJ’s setup.</li></ul><h2 id="Why-Choosing-the-Right-Template-Matters"><a href="#Why-Choosing-the-Right-Template-Matters" class="headerlink" title="Why Choosing the Right Template Matters?"></a>Why Choosing the Right Template Matters?</h2><p>Every DJ out there has their own unique style. This can be displayed by the music they play, the events they attend, the style of clothing they wear, and so on. Well, the same style can be represented by their videos as well.</p><p>With that said, it’s crucial that you make your video in such a way that your style is kept and immediately recognized by your fans. That can easily be achieved with a background template video for your set.</p><p>After all, your goal is to create an unforgettable experience that truly impresses everyone. You can do the same for live events as well as for your pre-recorded DJ sets.</p><h2 id="Sources-for-DJ-Template-Video-Downloads"><a href="#Sources-for-DJ-Template-Video-Downloads" class="headerlink" title="Sources for DJ Template Video Downloads"></a>Sources for DJ Template Video Downloads</h2><p>So, it’s finally time to look at the best places online where you can find the perfect DJ template video for you.</p><p>Let’s have a quick look at the top five.</p><ul><li><a href="#filmora1">Motion Elements</a></li><li><a href="#filmora2">Video Hive</a></li><li><a href="#filmora3">Pond5</a></li><li><a href="#filmora4">Filmora</a></li><li><a href="#filmora5">Mixkit</a></li></ul><h3 id="Motion-Elements"><a href="#Motion-Elements" class="headerlink" title="Motion Elements"></a>Motion Elements</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/motion-elements.png"                      alt="motion elements homepage"                ></p><p>Motion Elements has a massive directory of royalty-free elements creators can use.

However, not all templates are customizable.</p><p>In order for a template to be customizable, it has to be available in a format for tools such as Premiere Pro, Filmora, or many others. If it isn’t, then you are very limited with the editing if it’s an MP4 file, for example.</p><p>This is why using a DJ template video background on a full screen directly from a video editing tool like Filmora is the easiest solution for editing it. Any template you click from the tool will be fully editable, adjustable, and customizable.</p><p>You can control its colors, speed, animations, and so on.</p><h2 id="Technical-Considerations"><a href="#Technical-Considerations" class="headerlink" title="Technical Considerations"></a>Technical Considerations</h2><p>Now, if you want the best possible results with your video templates, you must put technical considerations into account. It’s not the most fun process but it is crucial. Luckily, this guide will make it easier.</p><p>So, consider the following:</p><h5 id="1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality"><a href="#1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Resolution and Quality"></a>1. Video Resolution and Quality</h5><p>Try to find high-definition or 4K templates. They will give the best visuals and be more flexible in editing or customization.</p><p>Also, choose templates that match your display setup’s aspect ratio, whether standard (16:9) or widescreen formats.</p><h5 id="2-Format-Compatibility"><a href="#2-Format-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="2. Format Compatibility"></a>2. Format Compatibility</h5><p>Common video formats like MP4, AVI, or MOV are widely supported by most DJ software and hardware. Ensure the template format is compatible with your equipment.</p><p>Additionally, think about the video codec you are using. Some codecs might not be supported by your playback system, or they might be too resource-intensive.</p><h5 id="3-Performance-and-Playback"><a href="#3-Performance-and-Playback" class="headerlink" title="3. Performance and Playback"></a>3. Performance and Playback</h5><p>The frame rate of the video should match that of your DJ software to avoid any sync issues. Common frame rates include 30fps and 60fps.</p><p>If your set is fairly long, make sure you’ve set the video template to loop seamlessly if you don’t want to look unprofessional.</p><h5 id="4-Audio-Sync"><a href="#4-Audio-Sync" class="headerlink" title="4. Audio Sync"></a>4. Audio Sync</h5><p>Some templates are designed to sync with the beat of the music. Check if the template has features that allow easy synchronization with your tracks.</p><p>You might also want to consider reactive templates. These are templates that change with the music and can add an engaging dynamic element to your performance.</p><h2 id="Legal-Aspects-and-Copyright"><a href="#Legal-Aspects-and-Copyright" class="headerlink" title="Legal Aspects and Copyright"></a>Legal Aspects and Copyright</h2><p>This part concerns most of us when using creative elements like these. So, it’s always a good idea to read the licenses and agreements before using anything.</p><p>Here are a couple of things you should always keep in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Read the Fine Print</strong>: Always read the licensing agreement of a template before using it. This agreement specifies how you can legally use the template, including any restrictions.</li><li><strong>Commercial vs. Non-Commercial Use</strong>: Some templates are only licensed for non-commercial use. If you’re using it for commercial purposes, ensure the template is cleared for such use.</li><li><strong>Attribution Requirements</strong>: Some licenses require you to credit the creator of the template. Make sure to follow these requirements where applicable.</li><li><strong>Modifications and Derivative Works</strong>: Be aware of any restrictions on modifying the template or creating derivative works based on it.</li></ul><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Hopefully, the information in this guide will be useful when you’re looking for the perfect DJ video template download. Remember what you learned here, and make sure you use the tools we suggested to find the best templates.

However, not all templates are customizable.</p><p>In order for a template to be customizable, it has to be available in a format for tools such as Premiere Pro, Filmora, or many others. If it isn’t, then you are very limited with the editing if it’s an MP4 file, for example.</p><p>This is why using a DJ template video background on a full screen directly from a video editing tool like Filmora is the easiest solution for editing it. Any template you click from the tool will be fully editable, adjustable, and customizable.</p><p>You can control its colors, speed, animations, and so on.</p><h2 id="Technical-Considerations-1"><a href="#Technical-Considerations-1" class="headerlink" title="Technical Considerations"></a>Technical Considerations</h2><p>Now, if you want the best possible results with your video templates, you must put technical considerations into account. It’s not the most fun process but it is crucial. Luckily, this guide will make it easier.</p><p>So, consider the following:</p><h5 id="1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality-1"><a href="#1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Resolution and Quality"></a>1. Video Resolution and Quality</h5><p>Try to find high-definition or 4K templates. They will give the best visuals and be more flexible in editing or customization.</p><p>Also, choose templates that match your display setup’s aspect ratio, whether standard (16:9) or widescreen formats.</p><h5 id="2-Format-Compatibility-1"><a href="#2-Format-Compatibility-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Format Compatibility"></a>2. Format Compatibility</h5><p>Common video formats like MP4, AVI, or MOV are widely supported by most DJ software and hardware. Ensure the template format is compatible with your equipment.</p><p>Additionally, think about the video codec you are using. Some codecs might not be supported by your playback system, or they might be too resource-intensive.</p><h5 id="3-Performance-and-Playback-1"><a href="#3-Performance-and-Playback-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Performance and Playback"></a>3. Performance and Playback</h5><p>The frame rate of the video should match that of your DJ software to avoid any sync issues. Common frame rates include 30fps and 60fps.</p><p>If your set is fairly long, make sure you’ve set the video template to loop seamlessly if you don’t want to look unprofessional.</p><h5 id="4-Audio-Sync-1"><a href="#4-Audio-Sync-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Audio Sync"></a>4. Audio Sync</h5><p>Some templates are designed to sync with the beat of the music. Check if the template has features that allow easy synchronization with your tracks.</p><p>You might also want to consider reactive templates. These are templates that change with the music and can add an engaging dynamic element to your performance.</p><h2 id="Legal-Aspects-and-Copyright-1"><a href="#Legal-Aspects-and-Copyright-1" class="headerlink" title="Legal Aspects and Copyright"></a>Legal Aspects and Copyright</h2><p>This part concerns most of us when using creative elements like these. So, it’s always a good idea to read the licenses and agreements before using anything.</p><p>Here are a couple of things you should always keep in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Read the Fine Print</strong>: Always read the licensing agreement of a template before using it. This agreement specifies how you can legally use the template, including any restrictions.</li><li><strong>Commercial vs. Non-Commercial Use</strong>: Some templates are only licensed for non-commercial use. If you’re using it for commercial purposes, ensure the template is cleared for such use.</li><li><strong>Attribution Requirements</strong>: Some licenses require you to credit the creator of the template. Make sure to follow these requirements where applicable.</li><li><strong>Modifications and Derivative Works</strong>: Be aware of any restrictions on modifying the template or creating derivative works based on it.</li></ul><h2 id="Summary-1"><a href="#Summary-1" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Hopefully, the information in this guide will be useful when you’re looking for the perfect DJ video template download.

However, these videos are getting the highest traction, and more videos are getting onboard about various products.</p><p>And, if you haven’t already checked one, an unboxing video is what it sounds like. At its core, “unboxing” is the procedure of recording the moment when a particular product is removed and opened from the packaging sold in.</p><p>Again, you’re probably thinking:</p><p>‘Why would anybody gaze at other folks opening their product packaging?’</p><p>More than 90,000 people type ‘unboxing’ into YouTube each month, and that’s quite interesting as well as strange. Also, these are just a few of the insane statistics about the eCommerce trend of unboxing videos.</p><p>In this article, you’ll see the science behind such unboxing videos and learn how to create an attractive one by taking inspiration from others.</p><p>So whether you’re not sure why we admire unboxing videos or you wish to know how to use them to your benefit, you’re in the right place!</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is an Unboxing Video?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">5 Best YouTube Unboxing Channels</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to Create a Killer Unboxing Video</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">FAQs about Unboxing Videos</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-an-Unboxing-Video"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-an-Unboxing-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is an Unboxing Video?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is an Unboxing Video?</strong></h2><p>Within the unboxing videos, people open boxes and narrate their actions. Unboxing videos are incredibly famous with kids, grabbing up tons of millions of subscribers as well as millions of views. Such videos are also usually great for kids to watch (with a few caveats). But the matter of the subject of some unboxing videos is not age-appropriate. And, there are niche-specific videos as well on different channels.</p><p>Are unboxers paid by the companies whose services or products they consider opening on YouTube? Companies don’t generally pay the YouTuber directly for featuring their products in a video. When an unboxer becomes super popular (with subscribers and tens of millions of views), companies may send the products for free, but not always. Sometimes hosts disclose this, sometimes not. However, companies do sponsor highly famous and influential YouTubers in other areas. For instance, they may pay the YouTuber to make a personal appearance at a toy store or convention.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-YouTube-Unboxing-Channels"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-YouTube-Unboxing-Channels" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best YouTube Unboxing Channels"></a><strong>Part 2: 5 Best YouTube Unboxing Channels</strong></h2><p>There are considerable merits to offering your customers a branded and personalized unboxing experience.</p><p>Even if you decide to get your products featured in a YouTuber’s unboxing videos, you can help promote your brand and improve brand awareness. So which is the perfect or ideal YouTube channel for unboxing videos for you to try to get featured on? The answer is: “It depends!”</p><p>Not every YouTuber is the best for every eCommerce business—and a YouTube channel simply being huge and influential doesn’t make it relevant for your brand. So it’s essential to consider brand suitability while trying looking for a YouTuber to create unboxing videos.</p><p>This means considering whether they use harsh language or if their target audience has some overlap with your target audience.</p><p>Keeping it in mind, here are some of the top YouTube unboxing channels for inspiration:</p><h3 id="1-Unbox-Therapy"><a href="#1-Unbox-Therapy" class="headerlink" title="1.

Select an Unboxing Niche</p><p>2. Practice Speaking Clearly and Slowly</p><p>3. Use the Best Unboxing Set-Up</p><p>4. Make Sure to Timely Unbox the Products</p><p>5. Don’t Delay the Unboxing in Your Video</p><p>6. Show the Product in Use</p><p>One of the prominent factors about unboxing videos is that anyone can make them. You don’t need to be uniquely talented but go with the products that have broad appeal. Once you create such videos, you can share them on your social media networks or personal website.</p><p>Do you want to create your creative unboxing videos for others to find? Do you like to introduce your customers to your products in your own YouTube Channel, so you have total control over the content and messaging of each video?</p><p>Here is a step by step guide to help you revamp the creation of your unboxing video:</p><h3 id="1-Use-a-Good-Camera-Video-Editing-Software"><a href="#1-Use-a-Good-Camera-Video-Editing-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Use a Good Camera &amp; Video Editing Software"></a>1. Use a Good Camera &amp; Video Editing Software</h3><p>While you probably don’t require that high-tech camera that professional Hollywood filmmakers would consider shooting or filming 8k+ ultra-HD movies, you need a good camera that can capture HD footage (preferably at least 1080p). This allows providing your unboxing videos just enough of a professional look to not deactivate or disable the interest of potential viewers.</p><p>In addition to a camera, ensure that you have a stand or a decent tripod for it. This way, you don’t have to hold onto your camera by yourself (or have an assistant hold it) while you’re filming. In addition, this minimizes camera shake, which assists in making easy-to-watch videos.</p><p>On the other hand, video editing software is a must for taking all of your video compiling and recording into a cohesive video that will be attractive for viewers to watch. There are tons of accessible video editing tools to choose from and some paid options that may have helpful features. However, our favorite pick is Wondershare Filmora due to its beginner-friendly yet professional editing elements. Let us know what you can’t do with this software! It’s a combination of professionalism and reliability you can consider for all your video editing needs.</p><p>The hottest feature of Wondershare Filmora for making attractive unboxing videos is audio ducking. With this feature, you can effectively lower the background vocals while adding your voiceovers.

Don’t Delay the Unboxing in Your Video</p><p>6. Show the Product in Use</p><p>One of the prominent factors about unboxing videos is that anyone can make them. You don’t need to be uniquely talented but go with the products that have broad appeal. Once you create such videos, you can share them on your social media networks or personal website.</p><p>Do you want to create your creative unboxing videos for others to find? Do you like to introduce your customers to your products in your own YouTube Channel, so you have total control over the content and messaging of each video?</p><p>Here is a step by step guide to help you revamp the creation of your unboxing video:</p><h3 id="1-Use-a-Good-Camera-Video-Editing-Software-1"><a href="#1-Use-a-Good-Camera-Video-Editing-Software-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Use a Good Camera &amp; Video Editing Software"></a>1. Use a Good Camera &amp; Video Editing Software</h3><p>While you probably don’t require that high-tech camera that professional Hollywood filmmakers would consider shooting or filming 8k+ ultra-HD movies, you need a good camera that can capture HD footage (preferably at least 1080p). This allows providing your unboxing videos just enough of a professional look to not deactivate or disable the interest of potential viewers.</p><p>In addition to a camera, ensure that you have a stand or a decent tripod for it. This way, you don’t have to hold onto your camera by yourself (or have an assistant hold it) while you’re filming. In addition, this minimizes camera shake, which assists in making easy-to-watch videos.</p><p>On the other hand, video editing software is a must for taking all of your video compiling and recording into a cohesive video that will be attractive for viewers to watch. There are tons of accessible video editing tools to choose from and some paid options that may have helpful features. However, our favorite pick is Wondershare Filmora due to its beginner-friendly yet professional editing elements. Let us know what you can’t do with this software! It’s a combination of professionalism and reliability you can consider for all your video editing needs.</p><p>The hottest feature of Wondershare Filmora for making attractive unboxing videos is audio ducking. With this feature, you can effectively lower the background vocals while adding your voiceovers. And, that’s extremely valuable in making these kinds of videos.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-1"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmorax boxpng"                ></p><h3 id="2-Prepare-Your-Stage-Photo-Lightbox-1"><a href="#2-Prepare-Your-Stage-Photo-Lightbox-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

Use a Good Camera &amp; Video Editing Software</h3><p>While you probably don’t require that high-tech camera that professional Hollywood filmmakers would consider shooting or filming 8k+ ultra-HD movies, you need a good camera that can capture HD footage (preferably at least 1080p). This allows providing your unboxing videos just enough of a professional look to not deactivate or disable the interest of potential viewers.</p><p>In addition to a camera, ensure that you have a stand or a decent tripod for it.

However, these videos are getting the highest traction, and more videos are getting onboard about various products.</p><p>And, if you haven’t already checked one, an unboxing video is what it sounds like. At its core, “unboxing” is the procedure of recording the moment when a particular product is removed and opened from the packaging sold in.</p><p>Again, you’re probably thinking:</p><p>‘Why would anybody gaze at other folks opening their product packaging?’</p><p>More than 90,000 people type ‘unboxing’ into YouTube each month, and that’s quite interesting as well as strange. Also, these are just a few of the insane statistics about the eCommerce trend of unboxing videos.</p><p>In this article, you’ll see the science behind such unboxing videos and learn how to create an attractive one by taking inspiration from others.</p><p>So whether you’re not sure why we admire unboxing videos or you wish to know how to use them to your benefit, you’re in the right place!</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is an Unboxing Video?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">5 Best YouTube Unboxing Channels</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to Create a Killer Unboxing Video</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">FAQs about Unboxing Videos</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-an-Unboxing-Video-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-an-Unboxing-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is an Unboxing Video?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is an Unboxing Video?</strong></h2><p>Within the unboxing videos, people open boxes and narrate their actions. Unboxing videos are incredibly famous with kids, grabbing up tons of millions of subscribers as well as millions of views. Such videos are also usually great for kids to watch (with a few caveats). But the matter of the subject of some unboxing videos is not age-appropriate. And, there are niche-specific videos as well on different channels.</p><p>Are unboxers paid by the companies whose services or products they consider opening on YouTube? Companies don’t generally pay the YouTuber directly for featuring their products in a video. When an unboxer becomes super popular (with subscribers and tens of millions of views), companies may send the products for free, but not always. Sometimes hosts disclose this, sometimes not. However, companies do sponsor highly famous and influential YouTubers in other areas. For instance, they may pay the YouTuber to make a personal appearance at a toy store or convention.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-YouTube-Unboxing-Channels-3"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-YouTube-Unboxing-Channels-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best YouTube Unboxing Channels"></a><strong>Part 2: 5 Best YouTube Unboxing Channels</strong></h2><p>There are considerable merits to offering your customers a branded and personalized unboxing experience.</p><p>Even if you decide to get your products featured in a YouTuber’s unboxing videos, you can help promote your brand and improve brand awareness. So which is the perfect or ideal YouTube channel for unboxing videos for you to try to get featured on? The answer is: “It depends!”</p><p>Not every YouTuber is the best for every eCommerce business—and a YouTube channel simply being huge and influential doesn’t make it relevant for your brand. So it’s essential to consider brand suitability while trying looking for a YouTuber to create unboxing videos.</p><p>This means considering whether they use harsh language or if their target audience has some overlap with your target audience.</p><p>Keeping it in mind, here are some of the top YouTube unboxing channels for inspiration:</p><h3 id="1-Unbox-Therapy-3"><a href="#1-Unbox-Therapy-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

As indicated by the Expert Voice: “remember that you compete for viewers’ attention with lots of other video content.

Without any further ado, let’s take a look.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Importing-the-video-clip-into-FCP"><a href="#Step-1-Importing-the-video-clip-into-FCP" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Importing the video clip into FCP"></a>Step 1: Importing the video clip into FCP</h4><p>This is, of course, the first thing that you need to do. Regardless of whether the original footage was taken by your smart phone, taken from the Internet or you’ve left it over from some past event that’s long overdue, you can easily import it into the FCP in order to edit it. FCP supports a variety of different formats, so it’s a good idea to try and import the video even if you are not quite sure about its extension. In order to do so, open the program, go to the File button, click on Import and select the file or the folder. This is going to get you to a regular finder window which would enable you to pick the clip that you want to do. If it’s not highlighted or you aren’t able to select it, the software doesn’t support it, and it’s not compatible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-files-in-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Import YouTube videos in FCP"                ></p><p>Keep in mind that if you want to import videos which have been published already, you can download them directly from the channel as MP4 files. If you want to store videos from different channels, you can use the Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate in order to get them converted and stored on your computer in a format that is supported by FCP.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Edit-YouTube-Videos-in-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#Step-2-Edit-YouTube-Videos-in-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Edit YouTube Videos in Final Cut Pro"></a>Step 2: Edit YouTube Videos in Final Cut Pro</h4><p>That’s the fun part. There are a few things that you can do with Final Cut Pro, and they are all quite professional.</p><ul><li>First, you can sync an audio track with your video as the DSLR cameras usually have terrible quality of the sound. This is why you want to get the audio recorded separately. The only thing you need to do is select the audio clip and click on the Synchronize Clips, and you are good to go.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sychronize-audio-clips-in-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Synchronize clips in FCP"                ></p><ul><li>Furthermore, you can do proper color balancing with the program quickly and incredibly easy. Go on Modify and then click on <strong>Balance Color</strong> and the software is going to take care of the rest on its own.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flip-clips-in-fcp-2.png"                      alt="adjust youtube video scale and position"                ></p><ul><li>You can also create previews when the video ends. In order to do so, you need to import your main clip, select a solid background color and place the preview video above it. You will then be able to trim and edit it conveniently. Adjust the scale and the position and you are good to go. Afterwards, you can also apply annotation on top of the preview.</li></ul><h4 id="Step-3-Upload-to-YouTube-from-the-software-directly"><a href="#Step-3-Upload-to-YouTube-from-the-software-directly" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Upload to YouTube from the software directly"></a>Step 3: Upload to YouTube from the software directly</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-to-youtube-from-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Upload video to YouTube from FCP"                ></p><p>This one is rather easy. Here is the sequence that you need to do. Go to File -&gt; Share -&gt; Master File -&gt; Setting -&gt; File -&gt; Share -&gt; YouTube. That’s basically it. Then you need to sign in to your YouTube account and simply click on Next -&gt; Publish and the entire thing is done. That’s all you need to do in order to quickly and conveniently upload your video to YouTube directly from the FCP.</p><p>Check this video tutorial to see how YouTube creators edit their YouTubes videos with Final Cut Pro</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-harnessing-the-potential-of-youtube-shorts-advertising/"><u>[New] In 2024, Harnessing the Potential of YouTube Shorts Advertising</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-ethical-approaches-to-achieve-one-million-youtube-subscribers-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Ethical Approaches to Achieve One Million YouTube Subscribers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-how-to-activate-or-deactivate-video-commenting-in-youtube-for-2024/"><u>[New] How To Activate or Deactivate Video Commenting in YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-how-to-create-youtube-channel-in-mobile-personal-and-business/"><u>[New] In 2024, How to Create YouTube Channel in Mobile [Personal & Business]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-from-script-to-screen-youtube-video-creation-made-simple/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  From Script to Screen  YouTube Video Creation Made Simple</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-from-passion-to-prominence-the-creators-quest-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] From Passion to Prominence  The Creator's Quest for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-innovate-transforming-raw-footage-into-youtube-thumbnails-via-smartphones-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How to Innovate  Transforming Raw Footage Into YouTube Thumbnails via Smartphones for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-essential-youtube-rules-for-content-creators-for-2024/"><u>[New] Essential YouTube Rules for Content Creators for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-fifas-favorite-footage-charted-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  FIFA's Favorite Footage  Charted on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-capitalize-on-youtube-shorts-must-knows-earning-prospects-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How to Capitalize on Youtube Shorts  Must-Knows, Earning Prospects for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/monetize-mastery-turning-views-into-revenue-on-vimeo-for-2024/"><u>Monetize Mastery  Turning Views Into Revenue on Vimeo for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-transformative-visuals-unleash-the-power-of-6-video-types/"><u>2024 Approved  Transformative Visuals  Unleash the Power of 6 Video Types</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-amplify-viewership-with-these-top-10-youtube-reaction-strategies-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Amplify Viewership with These Top 10 YouTube Reaction Strategies for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-enhancing-selfie-impact-on-instagram-the-zoom-guide/"><u>In 2024, Enhancing Selfie Impact on Instagram  The Zoom Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/chucklechief-your-1-tool-for-tweeting-gifs/"><u>ChuckleChief  Your #1 Tool for Tweeting Gifs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-creating-engaging-instagram-highlight-tags/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Creating Engaging Instagram Highlight Tags</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-frugal-cloud-cradle-for-copious-file-collection/"><u>[Updated] Frugal Cloud Cradle for Copious File Collection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-stream-apple-iphone-14-pro-max-to-computer-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Stream Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to Computer?

All of the music on this site is free.</p><p>One of the first things you’ll see when you arrive on Audiionautix is a ‘YouTube Friendly’ button. They know that most people browsing their music library are looking for songs for YouTube videos, and that want you to know their music is safe from copyright claims.</p><p>All of the music in the Audionautix collection was created by one man, Jason Shaw, but there’s still a huge variety of tracks.</p><p>On the front page of Audionautix, there are three selections you can make to start your music search – genre, mood, and tempo. Genres range from hard rock to bluegrass to techno (there are 28 genres in total), and the moods include things like ‘uplifting’, ‘evil’, and ‘bouncy’ (there are 37 of those). The tempos are fast, medium, and slow. So, if you want a medium-tempo acoustic song with a calming mood, you can easily find all of the songs that meet those qualifications.</p><p>Not every combination will deliver results, so it can be easier to just choose two of the three search parameters.</p><h4 id="2-Bensound"><a href="#2-Bensound" class="headerlink" title="2.

Beyond the titles of the tracks, each has a short description that will give you a good idea of what to expect from the song before you listen. You’ll need to listen to a song to know if you want it, but the descriptions are a fast way to figure out if you don’t want something. For example, ‘A New Beginning’ could be anything based on that title, but the description lets you know it’s ‘punk rock’ with an ‘epic&#x2F;achievement’ feeling.</p><p>You can narrow down the music you are shown by choosing a genre from the menu near the top of your page (there are 8 genres including cinematic, electronica, and corporate&#x2F;pop).

Because the watching experience is so similar across platforms and devices, YouTube TV is one of the most mobile-friendly solutions. However, it requires Wi-Fi or 4G to function, which means it lacks the offline capabilities of other alternatives.</p><p>● YouTube is popular among cord-cutters because of its extensive channel options. You’ll have to sift through the entire list of supported channels in your area to see whether it contains what you’re looking for. If so, YouTube TV may be all you need.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Stand-Out-on-YouTube-Innovative-Title-Brainstroms"><a href="#Stand-Out-on-YouTube-Innovative-Title-Brainstroms" class="headerlink" title="Stand Out on YouTube: Innovative Title Brainstroms"></a>Stand Out on YouTube: Innovative Title Brainstroms</h2><h1 id="Best-YouTube-Names-Generators-How-to-Brainstorm"><a href="#Best-YouTube-Names-Generators-How-to-Brainstorm" class="headerlink" title="Best YouTube Names Generators [+ How to Brainstorm]"></a>Best YouTube Names Generators [+ How to Brainstorm]</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                                     ></p><h5 id="Liza-Brown"><a href="#Liza-Brown" class="headerlink" title="Liza Brown"></a>Liza Brown</h5><p> Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>It’s important to have a good name for your YouTube channel – something that people will remember.

Here are 3 tools for getting started. Even if you don’t use one of the names you generate you’ll get some great inspiration.</p><h4 id="1-SpinXO"><a href="#1-SpinXO" class="headerlink" title="1. SpinXO"></a>1. SpinXO</h4><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><p> - Lots of options</p><p> - Checks availability</p><p>This is a great generator. If you were brainstorming yourself, you’d probably write out a bunch of words related to yourself and the kinds of videos you want to make and see what goes together. SpinXO does that for you, and mixes in other words that sound good in usernames.</p><p>Here’s what happened when I tried to name a hypothetical baking channel:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-name-generator-spinxo.jpg"                      alt="youtube name generator spinxo"                ></p><p>Not all of the results are great, but there are some cool sounding options in there.</p><p>One of the most useful features of SpinXO is that you can check the availability of the usernames. I liked the sound of CupcakesCupola, and when I clicked on it I was able to see that nobody else was using it on other sites.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-name-generator-spinxo-2.jpg"                      alt="youtube name generator spinxo"                ></p><h4 id="2-Name-Generator"><a href="#2-Name-Generator" class="headerlink" title="2.

Name Generator</h4><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong>  Can be hilarious</p><p> <strong>-</strong>  Names tend to be a bit long</p><p>This is a fairly limited generator. You plunk in a prefix and a suffix, and it generates a random word or term to stuff between them. Here’s what I got for my fictional cupcake channel:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/namegenerator-biz-example.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Name Generator"                ></p><p>So, on one hand - that’s hilarious and I’m considering legally changing my name. On the other hand, all of the results look exactly like this (which means they’re all a bit too long). It shows you a longer list if you scroll down:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/namegenerator-biz-example-generated.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Name Generator"                ></p><p>You can pick your favorite names and it’ll list them out so you can easily copy them into a word document. That’ll be useful if you’re collecting options from several sites.</p><h4 id="3-Username-Generator"><a href="#3-Username-Generator" class="headerlink" title="3. Username Generator"></a>3.

YouTube is the world’s biggest video sharing platform that already allows its users to stream live videos through third-party applications such as Wirecast Play or OBS. Less than a month ago, YouTube has finally made possible live streaming directly from a computer’s webcam. The option is currently only available on Chrome browsers, but the company claims that more browsers will start offering this feature soon.</p><p>In this article, we are going to provide you with all the information you’ll need to create seamless live streams using a webcam and introduce you to some of the best webcam models in 2021.</p><h2 id="Best-webcams-for-YouTube-Livestreaming-in-2021"><a href="#Best-webcams-for-YouTube-Livestreaming-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="Best webcams for YouTube Livestreaming in 2021"></a>Best webcams for YouTube Livestreaming in 2021</h2><p>The quality of the video recording you intend to broadcast live is essential for the success of your live streams. Most built-in laptop webcams produce low-quality videos, and for that reason using an external webcam that captures high-resolution videos can help you create live streams that attract a lot of attention from YouTube’s community.</p><h3 id="How-to-choose-the-right-webcam-for-live-streaming-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-choose-the-right-webcam-for-live-streaming-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to choose the right webcam for live streaming on YouTube?"></a>How to choose the right webcam for live streaming on YouTube?</h3><p><strong>Compatability:</strong> Even the best webcams on the market are completely useless if they are not compatible with your computer. Finding a webcam that works with a PC or a Mac shouldn’t be too difficult because both Windows and iOS platforms offer support for a wide range of models.</p><p><strong>Video Resolution:</strong> YouTubers that just want to produce simple live streams don’t have to pay a lot of attention to the video resolution, because their videos don’t show too many details. Vloggers and gamers, on the other hand, should consider using webcams that produce 4K or HD footage since lower-priced options have a hard time realistically depicting colors. The quality of the video output a webcam produces can increase its price significantly, so there’s no reason investing in it if you don’t have the intention of utilizing its features to the fullest.</p><p><strong>Sound Quality:</strong> Besides the video features, you should also look into the webcam’s audio options, because no one wants to watch a video with a terrible sound. Buying an external microphone is probably the best solution to this issue, but if you can’t afford one, then purchasing a webcam with decent audio recording features is the second best option.</p><p><strong>Adjustable Location:</strong> Although the angle from which you are recording a stream may not seem important, poorly framed live streams are more likely to go unnoticed.

He has done several collab videos and has a lot of advice about how to find potential partners. Here are 3 of his biggest tips:</p><h4 id="1-Approach-people-you-already-have-a-relationship-with"><a href="#1-Approach-people-you-already-have-a-relationship-with" class="headerlink" title="1. Approach people you already have a relationship with"></a>1. Approach people you already have a relationship with</h4><p>This could mean friends, people you have met at events like VidCon, or people who are subscribed to your channel. It is easier for someone to want to collaborate with you if they feel like they know you.</p><h4 id="2-Think-about-what-your-potential-partner-could-have-to-offer-your-existing-subscribers"><a href="#2-Think-about-what-your-potential-partner-could-have-to-offer-your-existing-subscribers" class="headerlink" title="2. Think about what your potential partner could have to offer your existing subscribers."></a><strong>2. Think about what your potential partner could have to offer your existing subscribers.</strong></h4><p>People sub to Roberto for tech advice, for example, so it makes sense for him to collaborate with people who have insights into technology. Collaborations should never be all about bringing in new subs – make your videos for the people who already watch your channel.</p><h4 id="3-Create-quality-content-consistently"><a href="#3-Create-quality-content-consistently" class="headerlink" title="3. Create quality content consistently."></a><strong>3. Create quality content consistently.</strong></h4><p>If you approach somebody about collaborating and they see that you haven’t posted in over a month, or that you don’t have many videos, it might be harder to get them to agree to work with you. The same goes if they watch your videos and don’t think they are at the same quality level as their videos.</p><h2 id="Tips-From-YouTube-Guru-Nich-Nimmin"><a href="#Tips-From-YouTube-Guru-Nich-Nimmin" class="headerlink" title="Tips From YouTube Guru Nich Nimmin"></a>Tips From YouTube Guru Nich Nimmin</h2><p>This is a collab video about collab videos! <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCei6wyubYC1I1FwZ54LZFiA" >Nick Nimmin’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> channel is all about YouTube, and Brandon’s channel <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRI6t05DNVlV0XhdI7hx%5Fiw" >OnePercentBetter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> has tons of cool self-development animations. It’s Brandon giving the tips in this video, and 3 of his best are:</p><h4 id="1-Use-the-person’s-name-when-you-contact-them"><a href="#1-Use-the-person’s-name-when-you-contact-them" class="headerlink" title="1. Use the person’s name when you contact them."></a><strong>1. Use the person’s name when you contact them.</strong></h4><p>This might seem obvious, but it is an easy mistake to make. If you send someone an email where you don’t use their name (maybe you just say ‘hey’) it will seem like you aren’t interested in them. Talking about a video of theirs you like can also help show your interest in them as a creator.</p><h4 id="2-Keep-it-simple"><a href="#2-Keep-it-simple" class="headerlink" title="2. Keep it simple."></a><strong>2. Keep it simple.</strong></h4><p>When you’re approaching someone for the first time, don’t overwhelm them with a long email. Limit yourself to around two paragraphs.</p><h4 id="3-Have-ideas"><a href="#3-Have-ideas" class="headerlink" title="3. Have ideas."></a><strong>3. Have ideas.</strong></h4><p>Don’t make your potential partner do the work of pitching ideas to you. Be open to their ideas, but come up with 1 or 2 ideas of your own you can mention when you approach the creator you want to work with. People will be more likely to say ‘yes’ to a specific idea than to the idea of collaborating in general, if they don’t already know you.</p><h2 id="Tips-From-Freelancer-Lifestyle-Vlogger-Amy-Schmittauer"><a href="#Tips-From-Freelancer-Lifestyle-Vlogger-Amy-Schmittauer" class="headerlink" title="Tips From Freelancer &#x2F; Lifestyle Vlogger Amy Schmittauer"></a>Tips From Freelancer &#x2F; Lifestyle Vlogger Amy Schmittauer</h2><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/savvysexysocial/featured" >Amy Schmittauer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> of Savvy Sexy Social does vlogs, lifestyle videos, and provides tips on being a freelancer. After doing several collabs in one week, she posted this video about how collaborations work best and how you should approach people you might want to work with.</p><h4 id="1-Networking-is-important-in-finding-collab-partners"><a href="#1-Networking-is-important-in-finding-collab-partners" class="headerlink" title="1. Networking is important in finding collab partners."></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Networking is important in finding collab partners.</strong></h4><p>Be nice to other creators when you meet them, offline or online, and build real relationships. Amy got to collaborate with <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/marquesbrownlee" >Marques Brownlee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (MKBHD) even though she had not met him before because <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/duncan33303" >Austin Evans <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> - who she had built a friendship with – vouched for her with him. When you are networking, think beyond what the immediate payoff could be.</p><h4 id="2-Don’t-stray-too-far-from-your-other-content"><a href="#2-Don’t-stray-too-far-from-your-other-content" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t stray too far from your other content."></a><strong>2. Don’t stray too far from your other content.</strong></h4><p>Aim to make your collab videos similar, content-wise, to the other videos on your channel. That way the new viewers you get from having the guest YouTuber in your video will be able to make an informed decision about whether they want to subscribe to you.</p><h4 id="3-Thank-the-people-you-work-with-in-your-videos"><a href="#3-Thank-the-people-you-work-with-in-your-videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Thank the people you work with in your videos."></a><strong>3. Thank the people you work with in your videos.</strong></h4><p>If you appeared in someone else’s video, you would probably appreciate it if they thanked you for being there, told their viewers to go check out your channel, and provided a link for them to do so. So, when you host someone else in one of your videos, that’s the kind of treatment you should give them. If you don’t, then the next person you want to collaborate with will see that and probably won’t want to work with you.</p><p> <em>Collab advice starts at around 2:10.</em></p><h2 id="Tips-From-Lifestyle-and-Fashion-YouTuber-MyLifeAsEva"><a href="#Tips-From-Lifestyle-and-Fashion-YouTuber-MyLifeAsEva" class="headerlink" title="Tips From Lifestyle and Fashion YouTuber MyLifeAsEva"></a>Tips From Lifestyle and Fashion YouTuber MyLifeAsEva</h2><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mylifeaseva/featured" >Eva Gutowski <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (MyLifeAsEva) is a lifestyle, fashion, and DIY YouTuber who has done numerous collaborations and believes in making real friends on YouTube. In the video above she shares some of her experiences and talks about how to come across as a real person when you approach other YouTubers about collaborating.</p><h4 id="1-Don’t-approach-other-YouTubers-as-a-‘fan’"><a href="#1-Don’t-approach-other-YouTubers-as-a-‘fan’" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t approach other YouTubers as a ‘fan’."></a><strong>1. Don’t approach other YouTubers as a ‘fan’.</strong></h4><p>If you want to be friends and collab partners, talk to other YouTubers as if you are their equal (which you are!). If you want to work with someone it’s probably because you like their videos, and there’s nothing wrong with saying so. Being all ‘omg, I love you, please subscribe to me too!’ isn’t likely to lead to a collab, though.</p><h4 id="2-Ask-questions"><a href="#2-Ask-questions" class="headerlink" title="2. Ask questions."></a><strong>2. Ask questions.</strong></h4><p>If you’re just trying to break the ice with someone, it is a good idea to as them a question – potentially about YouTube or one of their videos.

Most people don’t know how to exercise properly, which is why people who do are in demand on YouTube. If you have a strong command of good workout techniques, you can produce exercise videos that contain all the information viewers need for better workouts.</p><h4 id="2-Vitamins-Supplements"><a href="#2-Vitamins-Supplements" class="headerlink" title="2.  Vitamins, Supplements"></a>2.  Vitamins, Supplements</h4><p>There is a lot of confusion surrounding the topic of vitamins and food supplements. The internet is full of false prophets that often provide information about this topic that is not based on facts but on profit and their personal interests.</p><p>If you have the knowledge required to give instructions to others about fitness, then creating educational YouTube videos in which you share your personal opinions (and experiences) about supplements and vitamins may be a great way to gain more followers.</p><h4 id="3-Cheap-Fitness-No-Equipment-At-Home-Workouts"><a href="#3-Cheap-Fitness-No-Equipment-At-Home-Workouts" class="headerlink" title="3.  Cheap Fitness - No-Equipment At-Home Workouts"></a>3.  Cheap Fitness - No-Equipment At-Home Workouts</h4><p>No one should be forced to pay a fortune just to keep their bodies in shape, and we no longer have to. YouTube videos that show us how to exercise at home without expensive equipment are becoming increasingly popular. Fitness experts can gain a lot of attention from YouTube’s community if they can offer cheap and effective workout techniques anyone can try at home.</p><h4 id="4-Stretch-Videos"><a href="#4-Stretch-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4.  Stretch Videos"></a>4.  Stretch Videos</h4><p>Preparation is the key to success in everything, including working out. YouTube videos that teach viewers how to prepare themselves for a workout session can help you get views on YouTube. The best part is that people can always go back to your video anytime they need the warm-up techniques you teach in your videos which means repeat views and increased watch time.</p><h4 id="5-Full-length-Workout-Videos"><a href="#5-Full-length-Workout-Videos" class="headerlink" title="5.  Full-length Workout Videos"></a>5.  Full-length Workout Videos</h4><p>There are so many different fitness techniques out there, and most fitness instructors know more than just one workout technique. Creating a series of YouTube videos that offer detailed information on how to do Pilates, cardio, stretching, or injury rehabilitation exercises could provide you with more than enough material to fill your channel with content. Full-length workout videos show the entire training from the beginning until the end.</p><h4 id="6-Yoga-Routine"><a href="#6-Yoga-Routine" class="headerlink" title="6.  Yoga Routine"></a>6.  Yoga Routine</h4><p>Mastering Yoga is a lengthy process because there are so many different styles of Yoga routines. If you are familiar with the practices of Hasyayoga, Pranayama, or Kundalini Yoga then your YouTube videos can center on the most important exercises from one or all of the different schools of Yoga. Viewers of your yoga routine videos can’t learn all the poses and exercises after watching them just once, which means they’ll keep coming back until they feel confident that they can practice yoga independently.</p><h4 id="7-Exercise-Plans"><a href="#7-Exercise-Plans" class="headerlink" title="7.  Exercise Plans"></a>7.  Exercise Plans</h4><p>We all need to stick to some kind of a plan, no matter what we do. Structuring workouts and giving people a concise plan they should follow when they get to the gym (or in their home) can be beneficial for beginners and experienced athletes alike. These types of videos are ‘evergreen’ – they don’t become dated as time passes so new and returning audiences can continue to appreciate them.</p><h4 id="8-Motivational-Video"><a href="#8-Motivational-Video" class="headerlink" title="8.  Motivational Video"></a>8.  Motivational Video</h4><p>The lack of motivation is one of the most common reasons people have trouble getting in shape. We have trouble making ourselves start. If you are a motivational figure that can inspire others to establish a healthy lifestyle you could be a hit with this type of video. Develop your own way of motivating people, and strive to create a coherent style that fits your own personal philosophy of life.</p><h4 id="9-Meal-Plans-and-Dietary-Information"><a href="#9-Meal-Plans-and-Dietary-Information" class="headerlink" title="9.  Meal Plans and Dietary Information"></a>9.  Meal Plans and Dietary Information</h4><p>We are what we eat, and in order to stay fit, we must pay attention to everything we take into our system. The vast majority of gym goers don’t really know much about the food they should eat after workouts or how often they should eat. This provides a window of opportunity for you as somebody who does to produce YouTube videos that offer detailed advice on dieting should and regular daily meals for staying healthy and full of energy.</p><h4 id="10-Your-Fitness-Journey"><a href="#10-Your-Fitness-Journey" class="headerlink" title="10.  Your Fitness Journey"></a>10.  Your Fitness Journey</h4><p>Every story has a beginning, so creating a video for your YouTube channel that tells the viewers how your fitness journey began and what you had to go through to get where you are can help you develop a deeper bond with your YouTube followers. You can also document the preparation process for a great challenge, like a triathlon or a marathon, and show your followers what your daily exercise routines look like.</p><h4 id="11-Weight-Loss-Advice"><a href="#11-Weight-Loss-Advice" class="headerlink" title="11.  Weight Loss Advice"></a>11.  Weight Loss Advice</h4><p>For some people, weight can be a major health concern. A few years ago, the American Medical Association has classified obesity as a disease.

After all, it lets us narrate our story via two (or more) screens and gives our audience a superior viewing experience. Though, a lot of users find it hard to implement the split-screen effect on YouTube videos. Here, I will let you know how to come up with all kinds of YouTube split-screen videos by using a professional video editor.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Diverse-Applications-of-Split-screen-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-The-Diverse-Applications-of-Split-screen-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Diverse Applications of Split-screen Videos"></a>Part 1: The Diverse Applications of Split-screen Videos</h2><p>Before we discuss how to work on YouTube split-screen videos, let’s quickly consider some major applications of this video effect.</p><ul><li><h3 id="To-draw-a-direct-comparison"><a href="#To-draw-a-direct-comparison" class="headerlink" title="To draw a direct comparison"></a>To draw a direct comparison</h3></li></ul><p>One of the most popular applications of split-screen videos is for comparing two or more instances or perspectives in the same frame. For example, you might wish to depict the lifestyle of two people from different parts of the world or simply compare the effect of various seasons in a single video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-youtube-split-screen-video-1.jpg"                      alt="split screen video"                ></p><ul><li><h3 id="To-provide-two-or-more-perspectives"><a href="#To-provide-two-or-more-perspectives" class="headerlink" title="To provide two or more perspectives"></a>To provide two or more perspectives</h3></li></ul><p>Videos are the best visual storytelling tools and just like any story, they can also have different perspectives. Ideally, the split-screen effect would be one of the best ways to show your audience all kinds of perspectives that can take place in your story.</p><p>One of the best examples was depicted in the movie “500 Days of Summer” in which we got several Expectations vs. Reality shots. These split-screen shots depicted the two major perspectives of the story in a single frame.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-youtube-split-screen-video-2.jpg"                      alt="split screen video"                ></p><ul><li><h3 id="To-implement-the-cloning-effect"><a href="#To-implement-the-cloning-effect" class="headerlink" title="To implement the cloning effect"></a>To implement the cloning effect</h3></li></ul><p>Have you ever wondered how filmmakers create a clone of a person in movies? To do that, we make the protagonist record both the scenes in front of the same background. Later, we implement a split-screen effect in which both the clips are combined in such a way that it makes the audience believe as if the scene has both, the character and their clone placed flawlessly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-youtube-split-screen-video-3.jpg"                      alt="split screen video"                ></p><h3 id="Watch-Video-Use-Split-Screen-for-Your-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Watch-Video-Use-Split-Screen-for-Your-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Watch Video!
