A teacher should start a YouTube channel because it is beneficial to their students and themselves. The materials or content dished on these channels helps give lessons and instructions in the absence of the teacher, give a detailed explanation and trigger the students’ interest.</p><p>Also, it archives all the lessons for a long time and makes them easily accessible by both the present, past, and future students. Students can quickly go back for a review for upcoming exams. Through feedbacks or comments, teachers can provide answers to students with the problem of clarity.</p><p>A teacher needs to know what an educational video is, what makes an excellent educational video, and <strong>how to make an educational video for YouTube</strong> before opening a YouTube channel. Now, let’s delve into it!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-an-Educational-Video"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-an-Educational-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What’s an Educational Video?"></a>Part 1. What’s an Educational Video?</h2><p>From the name “educational video,” you can coin out that it is a video made for the sole purpose of educating or passing out knowledge for the sake of learning. The primary purpose of these videos is to teach an audience about a particular problem or important topics they want to learn about.</p><p>Sometimes brands use this method to advertise their brand while being a source of information.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Makes-a-Good-Educational-Video"><a href="#Part-2-What-Makes-a-Good-Educational-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What Makes a Good Educational Video?"></a>Part 2. What Makes a Good Educational Video?</h2><p>An excellent educational video aids the learning process. It triggers learners in analyzing and evaluating concepts provided by the video. Videos are great educational tools that most teachers must adopt due to their role in facilitating the learning process.</p><p>To make a good educational video, you should keep the following points in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Keep your students engaged</strong></li></ul><p>An excellent educational video should be eye catchy and exciting to get your student’s undivided attention. You can achieve it in any way, one of which is that you need to put yourself into the teaching mode, which means that you should give out the impression of your excitement for the course content you are talking about. Ask them questions, let them feel involved in the process. Please don’t go ahead talking with a cold tune. It makes them tired of listening or seeing the video.</p><ul><li><strong>Be sure to maintain a right-size of video length</strong></li></ul><p>It’s better shorter than longer. Have you ever seen a boring, long movie? It’s almost the same feeling you get seeing a long educational video.</p><p>The video should be straightforward to leverage the advantage of this form of learning. One needs to make this video of the right size for easy assimilation by the learner. Depending on the course topic, your video can be between <strong>2 - 20 minutes</strong> long.</p><p>Most importantly, don’t try to do much and use more straightforward, understandable concepts.</p><ul><li><strong>Stay focused</strong></li></ul><p>Making your videos focused and not running around many things helps it pass the information that plays a good role in video length management and engagement. Videos that try to divert from the topic may end up not hitting the nail on the head and not accomplishing their purpose.</p><ul><li><strong>Center your interest on the student’s needs</strong></li></ul><p>Any educational content should be centered to meet the needs of the students. That goes beyond creating content, but covers the entirety of satisfying the needs of your learners.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-a-Great-Educational-Video-for-YouTube"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-a-Great-Educational-Video-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Viewers find poor lighting distracting and it’s hard for them to see how great your content is if they are busy thinking about why your video is so dark. By creating a great lighting set up you can ensure that the people watching your videos are only thinking about how much they’re enjoying them.</p><p>Going outside and using natural light is the cheapest way to get a lot of light for your videos. If your vlog is not suited to the great outdoors then you need to get more strategic. You can turn on all the lights in your living room and still end up with a dark, grainy, video.</p><h2 id="Video-Lighting-Basics-Three-Point-Lighting"><a href="#Video-Lighting-Basics-Three-Point-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="Video Lighting Basics: Three Point Lighting"></a>Video Lighting Basics: Three Point Lighting</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/three-point-lighting.jpg"                      alt="Lighting for YouTube Video"                ></p><p>The most common technique of lighting a scene is called <strong>three-point lighting</strong>. It involves three different sources of light in the shot and is used by portrait photographers, which is also a great method for lighting your vlog.</p><p>The brightest source of light is also known as the <strong>key light</strong> which need to be high quality. A window will work, but if you do not have access to one where you are filming then consider an LED panel light or a softbox light like the ones used in portrait photography.</p><p>This first light will create a dramatic shadow across half of your face. You want to reduce this shadow, but not get rid of it completely.</p><p>Rather than setting up another light source on the opposite side of the camera, put up a reflector to bounce some light back onto your face. This reflector is called your <strong>‘Fill Light’</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>fill light</strong> is less bright than the primary source of light and it is placed on the side opposite to the key light. Its purpose is to reduce shadows produced by the key light and the reflector will need to be mounted on a stand.</p><p>The final step to creating three point lighting is to set up another light behind you. This is your ‘Backlight’, and it will help you stand out from your background. <strong>Backlight or Hair light</strong> is always placed behind and above the subject to create separation between the subject in the shot and the background. This basic lighting technique can be applied in almost every scene you shoot, which is why it is important to keep an open mind and to continue experimenting with possible light setups.</p><h3 id="Watch-Video-Top-Lighting-Tips-for-Vlogging"><a href="#Watch-Video-Top-Lighting-Tips-for-Vlogging" class="headerlink" title="Watch Video! Top Lighting Tips for Vlogging"></a>Watch Video! Top Lighting Tips for Vlogging</h3><h2 id="Lightning-Tips-for-Aspiring-YouTube-Videographers"><a href="#Lightning-Tips-for-Aspiring-YouTube-Videographers" class="headerlink" title="Lightning Tips for Aspiring YouTube Videographers"></a>Lightning Tips for Aspiring YouTube Videographers</h2><p>Becoming the master of light will take some time and practice, so it is crucial to remain curious and anxious to learn new tricks throughout that process if you want to continually become better. These tips will help you make the first steps on that journey.</p><h4 id="1-Focus-Your-Key-Light"><a href="#1-Focus-Your-Key-Light" class="headerlink" title="1.  Focus Your Key Light"></a>1.  Focus Your Key Light</h4><p>Try to focus your Key Light so that it lights only you and not your background. Do this by mounting anything that can cast a shadow onto your Key Light to control the area where the light hits. If you are using a window for your Key Light then you can use a curtain. If you use a softbox light then your light will already be somewhat focused.</p><h4 id="2-Use-Natural-Lighting"><a href="#2-Use-Natural-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Natural Lighting"></a>2. Use Natural Lighting</h4><p>The light provided by the Sun is still the best light source, you can have in your video. The trouble is that natural light changes quickly, which makes it highly unpredictable. The best way to deal with this challenge is to come prepared to the set and to get the shot you want as quickly as you can.</p><h4 id="3-Try-DIY-Lightning"><a href="#3-Try-DIY-Lightning" class="headerlink" title="3.  Try DIY Lightning"></a>3.  Try DIY Lightning</h4><p>Literally, anything from candles to LED light bulbs can serve as a source of light in a shot. You just need to pay attention to the light temperature, because warmer light sources may highlight reds and yellows that can make your footage look less realistic.</p><h4 id="4-Use-Lightning-Kits"><a href="#4-Use-Lightning-Kits" class="headerlink" title="4. Use Lightning Kits"></a>4. Use Lightning Kits</h4><p>This is by far the best option if you want to be in complete control of the light on your set. You can adjust the intensity of the lights, use filters, diffusers and all sorts of other accessories to create the light that flatters the subjects of your videos. The only downside is that you’ll have to spend a considerable amount of money if you want to have a professional lighting kit.</p><h4 id="5-Set-up-reflectors"><a href="#5-Set-up-reflectors" class="headerlink" title="5.  Set up reflectors"></a>5.  Set up reflectors</h4><p>Sets of reflectors are often under $50, so they are fairly affordable. However, some vloggers choose to forgo purchasing reflectors and make their own out of tinfoil.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lighting-tips01.JPG"                      alt="lighting tips"                ></p><p>If your strong main light is too hard on your eyes then you can use a translucent ‘reflector’ to soften it. Set your translucent reflector, or other screen, up in front of your main light to diffuse it.</p><p>If you are hosting a <strong>beauty vlog</strong> then you might consider a slightly different set up. Instead of having your main light off to one side set it up directly in front of you so your entire face is lit evenly. It is still a good idea to use fill lights in this set up to give you some dimension, and a backlight is even more essential for helping you stand out from the background. The even light hitting your face will also make you look flat if you do not use a backlight.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lighting-tips02.JPG"                      alt="lighting tips"                ></p><p>If you are using all of the lighting options available to you and your video still looks too dark then you can try brightening it by <strong>opening up the aperture of your camera</strong> lens&#x2F;setting a lower f-stop. Letting more light into your camera can help your footage look brighter, although you also run the risk of making things look overexposed&#x2F; washed out if you are not careful.</p><p>If you are stuck shooting in <strong>low light conditions</strong> it is best to use a lens with a wider aperture&#x2F;lower f-stop. This will make the best of the light you do have.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-harnessing-the-power-of-visual-appeal-in-your-youtube-advertising/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Harnessing the Power of Visual Appeal in Your YouTube Advertising</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-buy-youtube-views-everything-you-need-to-know/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  How to Buy YouTube Views - Everything You Need To Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-harnessing-imovies-capabilities-for-youtube-video-perfection/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Harnessing iMovie's Capabilities for YouTube Video Perfection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-free-youtube-earning-predictors/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Free YouTube Earning Predictors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-get-thousands-of-youtube-views-in-30-days/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  How To Get Thousands of YouTube Views in 30 Days</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-from-vlogger-to-earnest-by-year-end-following-sourav-joshis-examples/"><u>[New] In 2024, From Vlogger to Earnest by Year End - Following Sourav Joshi's Examples</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-stream-to-youtube-facebook-twitch-and-over-30-platforms/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  How to Stream to YouTube, Facebook, Twitch and Over 30 Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-essential-techniques-in-youtube-movie-production-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Essential Techniques in YouTube Movie Production for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-free-guide-perfecting-your-youtube-audio-to-text-conversion-for-2024/"><u>[New] Free Guide  Perfecting Your YouTube Audio-to-Text Conversion for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-fundamentals-of-animation-and-graphic-expression/"><u>[New] Fundamentals of Animation and Graphic Expression</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/top-imei-unlokers-for-your-oppo-k11x-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>Top IMEI Unlokers for Your Oppo K11x Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-transform-audio-experience-the-simplified-guide-for-tiktok-users/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Transform Audio Experience  The Simplified Guide for TikTok Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-unresponsive-touch-screen-on-honor-80-pro-straight-screen-edition-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Fix Unresponsive Touch Screen on Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-detailed-steps-to-rotate-videos-in-blender/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Detailed Steps to Rotate Videos in Blender</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-unraveling-the-mystery-of-ad-driven-content-creation-cpm/"><u>In 2024, Unraveling the Mystery of Ad-Driven Content Creation (CPM)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-guiding-principles-for-swapping-gender-on-instagram-facebook-and-snapchat-pics/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Guiding Principles for Swapping Gender on Instagram, Facebook & Snapchat Pics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-gopros-360-degree-spectacle-max-vs-hero-11-showdown/"><u>[Updated] GoPro's 360-Degree Spectacle  Max vs Hero 11 Showdown</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/unlicensed-legal-tracks-downloads-for-gaming-for-2024/"><u>Unlicensed Legal Tracks Downloads for Gaming for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-first-flight-fun-best-easy-to-use-drones/"><u>In 2024, First Flight Fun  Best Easy-to-Use Drones</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

In our guide, you will find an answer to this, along with related queries like how YouTube highlighted comment works, the removal process, its benefits, and more.</p><p>If you own a YouTube channel or are starting one, even you can do this. Without further ado, let’s jump straight into the core of YouTube’s highlighted comments. We’ve categorized this article into a total of 8 parts for simple and better understanding.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Does Highlighted Comment Mean On YouTube?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: What Does Highlighted Comments Look Like on YouTube?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Make Comment Highlighted?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Highlighted Comments URL?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: How to Reply to Highlighted Comments?</a></li><li><a href="#part6">Part 6: How to Remove Highlighted Comments?</a></li><li><a href="#part7">Part 7: Tips for Writing a Comment</a></li><li><a href="#part8">Part 8: Benefits of Highlighted Comments</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Mean-On-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Mean-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does The Highlighted Comment Mean On YouTube?"></a>Part 1: What Does The Highlighted Comment Mean On YouTube?</h2><p>Before you get on with highlighting your comments, you must understand what it means exactly. You may follow comments on the videos posted by several YouTubers, but the highlighted ones are always making it to the top of the list.</p><p>Having said that, neither the content creator nor users or moderators choose to highlight YouTube comments to begin with. They are no rocket science, but only a tad bit more than what you know as a bookmarking feature.</p><p>Think of highlighted comments as a “tag”. You might notice this in the form of a ‘new activity YouTube notification’ link you receive on your registered email. Only you can see this tag when you click the notification and arrive at Youtube.com to either view or reply to a comment.</p><p>Highlighting comments (HC’s) are an automatic feature generated by YouTube. It draws the YouTuber’s &amp; viewer’s attention to relevant activities. Don’t fail to notice that the highlight disappears once you are done interacting in the tagged comment thread. However, they are reloadable by tapping the comment timestamp.</p><p>For instance, you may want to check the following links. The 2 URLs lead you to the same video, but only one of them shows a highlighted comment.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p>Notice the name “lc” in the first URL- that stands for linked comment. YouTube might include this additional parameter. If a reply comment (HR) gets highlighted, the parent comment gets raised to the top.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Look-Like"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Look-Like" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does The Highlighted Comment Look Like?"></a>Part 2: What Does The Highlighted Comment Look Like?</h2><p>YouTube has been working on improving the navigation of the comment section for videos, and highlighted comments are one of them. These comments appear even above the pinned comments on a video. The label of a highlighted comment is displayed above the commentator’s name in a light grey shade.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-comments.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Comments"                ></p><p>YouTube labels comment replies as well and call it “Highlighted Reply.” You can see this tag above the replier’s name in the same color tone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-reply.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Reply"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-My-Comment-Highlighted"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-My-Comment-Highlighted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make My Comment Highlighted?"></a>Part 3: How to Make My Comment Highlighted?</h2><p>Now, making YouTube highlight your comment on a popular video is nothing less than an art. YouTube doesn’t make it easy for you. The advantage of getting your comment highlighted on YouTube is limitless.</p><p>Thus, anybody who wants to get their YouTube comment an HC tag has to follow a few simple steps, which we will discuss below in another section. Finding the correct or relevant video content that can benefit your channel from such a comment is an excellent place to start.</p><p>For example, if you are a YouTuber who deals in tech information, you need to look for a popular video or channel with a similar genre, in this case, technical knowledge. The more popular the channel is, the more is the chance of a viewer checking the comments on its videos. You will only benefit if you’re comment is highlighted on pages of Youtuber’s who are huge.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Get-the-URL-of-Highlighted-Comments"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Get-the-URL-of-Highlighted-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Get the URL of Highlighted Comments?"></a>Part 4: How to Get the URL of Highlighted Comments?</h2><p>The ways to acquire the URL or link for a highlighted comment are different for both parties- viewer and host.</p><p>Suppose you are a viewer who is going through the comments section of a video. If you want to get the highlighted URL for the comment, simply click on the timestamp (e.g., 2 weeks ago) beside the commentator’s username.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-comments.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Comments"                ></p><p>On the other hand, for a YouTuber, getting access to the comment URL is relatively straightforward. The host will get a notification on his or her registered email-id when a viewer publishes a comment on their posted video. You will find the link to the highlighted comment in the notification</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Reply-to-Highlighted-Comments"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Reply-to-Highlighted-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Reply to Highlighted Comments?"></a>Part 5: How to Reply to Highlighted Comments?</h2><p>Replying to “highlighted comments” on your YouTube channel is pretty easy since this feature was developed, keeping the user’s convenience in mind. If you want to follow up or reply to such comments, you can do so from your email or YouTube Dashboard.</p><p>If you click the notification bell icon, whenever a viewer drops a new comment on one of your videos, YouTube will send you a notification via email. On opening the email, you will find a clickable “Reply” option. Or else, if you follow the comment section in the YouTube Dashboard, you can directly view or reply to highlighted comments from here as well.</p><p>Have you ever wondered why a highlighted comment always shows at the top of the comment list? Both the above options will lead you to the comment thread on YouTube. To help you find the new activity easily, it appears with the highlight tag on it. The purpose is to remind you that you are here for that specific comment.</p><h2 id="Part-6-How-to-Remove-Highlighted-Comments"><a href="#Part-6-How-to-Remove-Highlighted-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: How to Remove Highlighted Comments?"></a>Part 6: How to Remove Highlighted Comments?</h2><p>Can you, as a video maker, remove highlighted comments on YouTube? The direct answer to this would be a ‘No.’ It is because based on how you have opened the specific video, YouTube does it automatically.</p><p>Alternatively, you can try out a few temporary solutions.</p><ol><li>You can edit the particular URL of the video where the highlighted tag is showing. Remove the red part of the URL (example given below) starting with “&amp;”:</li></ol><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> After removing the above parameter, reload the original video link (below):</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ol><li>Try logging out from your Google Account and browse YouTube (anonymously). Doing this will ensure that you no longer see any highlighted comments. However, at the same time, this will restrict you from interacting in any way with that video, let alone leaving a comment.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-7-Tips-for-Writing-a-Comment-that-will-be-Pinned-as-a-Highlighted-Comment"><a href="#Part-7-Tips-for-Writing-a-Comment-that-will-be-Pinned-as-a-Highlighted-Comment" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Tips for Writing a Comment that will be Pinned as a Highlighted Comment?"></a>Part 7: Tips for Writing a Comment that will be Pinned as a Highlighted Comment?</h2><p>Many frequently inquire on the internet about how they can improve the chances of getting their comment pinned, as highlighted on YouTube. The secret lies in how you write the statement. We’ve listed a few pro tips below that can help:</p><ul><li>First, go through all the posted comments under the video. It will help you identify what is missing. You can comment or write the missing point in comprehendible and straightforward words. Also, never forget to acknowledge the YouTuber’s talent.</li><li>Remember, no one has the time to read long comments. So, when you know what you want to write, try to shorten your sentences. A short and crisp comment draws more attention.</li><li>After you have framed your comment, make sure that it is grammatically correct. YouTube and Google hate grammatical errors.</li><li>Do not hit the post option already. Before publishing it, you must cross-check that your comment has all the above points in place.</li><li>Lastly, you have to wait after publishing on the video’s comment section. YouTube will highlight your comment if it passes according to the YouTube policy and if the search engine finds it unique.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-8-Are-Highlighted-Comments-Beneficial"><a href="#Part-8-Are-Highlighted-Comments-Beneficial" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Are Highlighted Comments Beneficial?"></a>Part 8: Are Highlighted Comments Beneficial?</h2><p>Being a convenience feature, a highlighted comment on YouTube is 100% beneficial. That is especially true if you are looking for ways to optimize your channel.</p><p>YouTube is undeniably the second largest search engine on the web. Highlight comments can potentially increase the outreach of your content and, consequently, your brand presence.</p><p>As said earlier, these comments always show first on the comment section. Needless to say, many people who watch the videos also scroll down to the comments section to start a conversation or see what other viewers are saying about this video.</p><p>In the process, alongside the interaction, they also check out the channels or profiles of the commentators. Viewers often visit the pages of these channels, and if they happen to enjoy the video content, they will subscribe to the YouTuber’s channel. If your comment gets highlighted, your YouTube channel can be one of them.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>YouTube can be an intimidating tool for marketing and more so for newcomers. Every YouTuber wishes that their channel performs better than the previous day. Even though the highlighted comment or highlighted reply feature doesn’t have any direct benefits, it can indeed help in optimizing your YouTube channel.</p><p>It can connect you with potential viewers and increase the number of people that visit your channel regularly. However, how many of them stay and hit the “Subscribe” button is a different story altogether and is wholly based on whether they like what you share through your videos.</p><p>In this article, we have shared facts on YouTube’s commonly seen highlighted comment feature. Yet, the term is a heavily misleading one, as far as viewers and Youtuber’s are concerned. We have also covered all other aspects and queries related to this term.

How you set up your talking-head shot depends on many factors, including how much space you have, what kind of look you’re going for, and how many people you want to fit in one frame. Here are four ways to set up your talking-head shots for YouTube.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Table of Contents <a href="#Close-Quarters-Wide-Angle-Vlog-Set-Up">1.

It is welcomed to share on social media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/talking-heads-youtube-video-shots-set-up.jpg"                      alt="Setting up Talking Heads Video Shots for YouTube"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Set-Up-Your-Talking-Head-Shots-for-YouTube-4-Ways"><a href="#How-to-Set-Up-Your-Talking-Head-Shots-for-YouTube-4-Ways" class="headerlink" title="How to Set Up Your Talking-Head Shots for YouTube [4 Ways]"></a>How to Set Up Your Talking-Head Shots for YouTube [4 Ways]</h2><h3 id="1-Close-Quarters-Wide-Angle-Vlog-Set-Up"><a href="#1-Close-Quarters-Wide-Angle-Vlog-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="1.  Close Quarters Wide-Angle Vlog Set-Up"></a>1.  Close Quarters Wide-Angle Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>Don’t have a lot of space to set up your camera and lighting equipment? No problem! You can be within an arm’s length away from your camera with a close quarters wide-angle vlog set-up.</p><p>With this set-up, you’re going to need a camera with a wide-angle lens, a tripod, a camera-mounted shotgun mic for sound, and a ring light for light.</p><p>Set your camera on the tripod and mount the shotgun mic directly on the camera shoe (the electronic bracket on the top of the camera). Inside the circular space of your ring light, position your camera right in the middle of it so that you can shoot your video through it without getting any part of the lighting equipment in your shot.</p><p>In the video above, Sean Cannell demonstrates this set-up. As you can see from this example, the wide-angle lens is able to squeeze in a lot of what’s in front of the camera into the shot.</p><p>Objects and people that just make it into the sides of the frame will appear more stretched out as the wide-angle causes distortion and enhances perspectives.</p><p>If you look closely into Sean’s eyes, you can also see a specular highlight in the shape of a circle. Many people like the way eyes look against a ring light.</p><h3 id="2-Medium-Vlog-Set-Up"><a href="#2-Medium-Vlog-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="2.  Medium Vlog Set-Up"></a>2.  Medium Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>If you have more space and want to shoot a more professional-looking talking-head shot with more realistic perspectives, a medium vlog set-up may be a better alternative for you.</p><p>For this set-up, you’ll be using a slightly longer standard&#x2F;normal lens (like a 35mm or a 50mm lens) attached to your camera which would be set on a tripod. Since this longer lens will show less of the surrounding areas as it “zooms” closer into whatever is in front, you will need to sit further back, away from your camera.</p><p>Now that you’re further away from your camera, a camera-mounted shotgun mic may not be the best mic for you. For better sound recording, you’ll need a shotgun mic fixed on a mic stand that is set up like a boom mic, positioned just outside of your camera frame.</p><p>At the 39 second mark of the above video, electronic music producer deadmau5 is positioned right in the center of this particular set-up.</p><p>You can see from how even the background and couch looks across the entire camera frame that there is no distortion or enhanced perspective.</p><p>It appears that, to the right of deadmau5 (camera left), there is a key light and to his left (camera right) there may be a fill light for additional lighting. Behind the couch, there’s also a background uplight to create depth between the subject and the background. At the 1:30 mark of this trailer video, you can briefly see how the Masterclass camera crew set up their shot.</p><h3 id="3-Two-Person-Vlog-Set-Up"><a href="#3-Two-Person-Vlog-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="3.  Two Person Vlog Set-Up"></a>3.  Two Person Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>If your talking-head shot has got to include two people, you can use a similar set-up as the medium vlog set-up detailed above.</p><p>If you look back at the 39-second mark of deadmau5’s Masterclass trailer, you can see that there’s a lot of space to the left and right of deadmau5. Now imagine the same shot but with two people.</p><p>With two people, though, you’ll want to set up your mic slightly differently. Rather than using a directional shotgun mic with a narrow area of sensitivity, you’ll want to use a directional mic with a wider area of sensitivity.</p><h3 id="4-Long-Teleprompter-Vlog-Set-Up"><a href="#4-Long-Teleprompter-Vlog-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="4.  Long Teleprompter Vlog Set-Up"></a>4.  Long Teleprompter Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>If you want to read over a script but still make it appear like you’re looking straight into the camera, you’ll need to use a long teleprompter vlog set-up.</p><p>For this set-up, you’ll need all the same equipment as the medium vlog set-up, but you’ll additionally need a teleprompter placed in front of your camera equipped with a long telephoto lens.</p><p>You will have to sit much further back away from your camera for two main reasons. Firstly, you want to be able to fit yourself in your much more zoomed-in camera frame (effect of the long telephoto lens). Secondly, you want to be far enough that the camera cannot detect your eyes reading from left to right. You’ll want to be around six meters away from a 17” teleprompter monitor or around four meters away from a 10” teleprompter monitor.</p><p>In the above video, Jared Polin uses a long teleprompter vlog set-up.</p><p>In the video, he says there’s about 8 feet (2.4 meters) between himself and his lens. At the 1:15 mark of his video, Jared demonstrates how this set-up works.</p><p>It is difficult to know whether the movement in his eyes is caused by not being far enough from the lens or from his horizontal nystagmus condition in his eyes.</p><p>Looking to find the right lights for your video recording set?

It’s a big world where new things happen every day, in every <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube niche <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. One of the best ways to climb to the top of YouTube’s search engine results is to be among the first creators to make a video about a trending topic.</p><p>But how do you know what’s trending? If you’re in a huge genre like beauty or technology then it’s not impossible to keep track of the latest news and trends, but you probably hear about things as other people start making videos and as websites start publishing articles. How do you get on top of trends just as they’re becoming trends?</p><p>Google Trends, of course!</p><p>Google Trends is a completely free tool you can use to determine what’s trending on YouTube or in Google’s search engine. Here’s how you can use Google Trends to figure out what’s trending in your niche and make a video before there’s tons of competition.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Seeing-The-Big-Picture"><a href="#Part-1-Seeing-The-Big-Picture" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Seeing The Big Picture"></a>Part 1: Seeing The Big Picture</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-use-google-trends-to-come-up-with-video-seeing-big-picture.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends YouTube Ideas"                ></p><p><em>You’ll need to be signed into your Google account to use Google Trends.</em></p><p>Start off at <a class="link"   href="https://trends.google.com/trends/" >trends.google.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and you’ll see what’s trending in general – usually big news stories or things like sports finals. The data is laid out like this: at the top there are three ‘Featured Insights’. These are three of the most popular trending topics paired with graphs of their recent search traffic. Underneath these there will be a list of stories that are currently trending. You can click on them to see charts of their search data and links to where the stories are being covered online.</p><p>Unless you do news or political commentary on your channel these probably aren’t topics you want to cover, but if you like to insert some topical references into your other videos then it’s still good to be aware of these things.</p><p>To get information more relevant to your channel you’re going to have to do some filtering.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Getting-Results-That-Matter-to-You"><a href="#Part-2-Getting-Results-That-Matter-to-You" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Getting Results That Matter to You"></a>Part 2: Getting Results That Matter to You</h2><p>In the Google Trend home page, scroll down to the ‘Recently Trending’ section and click on ‘More Trending Searches’.</p><p>Then click from ‘Daily Search Trends’ to ‘Realtime Search Trends’.</p><p>On top you will see two drop-down menus, one is for the category and one is for location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-video-ideas.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Video Ideas"                ></p><p>Under <strong>All categories</strong> select the general theme your channel falls under.</p><p>Your options are business, entertainment, health, Sci&#x2F;Tech, sports, and top stories.</p><p>It might be the case that your channel doesn’t fall under any of these themes, but there could still be related stories for you in other categories. For example, if you have a beauty channel then there could be something that’d interest you under health, entertainment, or even business.</p><p>Under the <strong>location menu</strong> choose the region most of your viewers are from. This might not be the same as where you are from – you could be in Australia and most of your viewers could be in the U.S. If you’re not sure where your viewers are from you can find out in your <strong>Creator Studio</strong> under <strong>Analytics &gt; Demographics</strong>.</p><p>Once you have narrowed down your results you can just scroll through and pick out a topic related to your channel’s theme that you have something to say about.</p><p>For example, if you have a gaming channel and you’re looking for a non-gameplay topic to make a video on, you would look under Sci&#x2F;Tech. If I look under that category today (May 29, 2017) and specify that I want topics trending in the United States then these are my top 5 results:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-categories.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Category YouTube Video Ideas"                ></p><p>The first two happen to be about gaming. If you, as a gamer, had any strong reaction to either of these topics – whether it’s that you feel like you’re knowledgeable about them, or that you’re excited by something that’s coming up, or that something made you groan – then that would be a sign that you should make a video. Capitalizing on a trend while also covering a topic you have a lot to say about is always a good move.</p><p>Having something to say doesn’t have to mean having a strong opinion. If you just find something interesting and want to pass the information along to your viewers then that’s great too.</p><p>Clicking on these results will give you more specific data including how often the topic has been searched recently and links to recent news articles. These can give you a better idea of why it is trending and help you come up with what you want to say.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Battle-of-the-Keywords"><a href="#Part-3-Battle-of-the-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Battle of the Keywords"></a>Part 3: Battle of the Keywords</h2><p>Once you have a topic in mind for your next video – whether it came from Google Trends or your own noggin – think about what the most important keyword for that topic might be.</p><p>A <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/the-12-step-youtube-seo-guide-for-beginners-who-want-more-448.html" >keyword is a word or short phrase <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that people type into a search engine like Google or YouTube. In order for people to find your videos, you’ll have to include a keyword in your video’s title.</p><p>Once you have a keyword in mind, type it into the Explore bar at the top of your page in Google Trends.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/explore-topic-in-google-trends.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Keywords YouTube Video"                ></p><p>What happens after you click <strong>enter</strong> is pretty much magic. Say I want to make a video on how to use Filmora. The first thing I’ll type into that Explore bar is ‘Filmora’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-search-term.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends YouTube Video Keywords"                ></p><p>You can see near the top that this chart represents searches for the topic over the last 5 years, which isn’t necessarily useful (although it is sort of cool that you can see when Filmora was ‘born’). I’m going to narrow that down to results from the U.S in the last week.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-search-term-time-range.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends YouTube Video Ideas Filmora"                ></p><p>There, now I can see how the popularity of Filmora as a search term has spiked on specific days and times (if you hover over a spike it tells you the time and day) and plan to post my video at a time that capitalizes on these trends.</p><p>Next, what other words do I want to include in my video title? Is this a review, a tutorial, or a how-to? By clicking on my search term Filmora, I can edit it to read ‘filmora review’. Then I can click <strong>+ Compare</strong> and type in ‘filmora tutorial’ and ‘how to use Filmora’. Google Trends will create a chart comparing the popularity of those 3 terms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-search-term-comparison.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Filmora Keywords"                ></p><p><em>I also ‘zoomed out’ to 90 days – if I’d only looked at how they compared over the last week my results could have been skewed.</em></p><p>It’s pretty clear from the chart that ‘filmora review’ is the strongest of those 3 search terms. The title of my video should definitely start with the words <strong>Filmora Review</strong> because that is what most people are searching for when they want information about Filmora. Putting your most important keyword&#x2F;search term first in your video titles will help them rank better in the viewer’s search results.</p><p>Although, when you do a comparison like this you should also go to YouTube and search for each potential keyword&#x2F;phrase individually. It might turn out that there is a ton of strong competition for the most popular search term, and not as much for the second or third most popular. Here’s a search for ‘Filmora Review’ on YouTube:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-youtube-keyword-search.jpg"                      alt="YouTube search Filmora Keyword"                ></p><p><em>If my view of YouTube looks different from yours it’s because I’m using the <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vidiq-vision-for-youtube/pachckjkecffpdphbpmfolblodfkgbhl?hl=en" >VidIQ plugin for Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s free and it gives you all kinds of extra info about videos and channels.</em></p><p>The second-highest ranked result is only 2 months old and isn’t from a huge channel. Although there is competition for this keyword, ranking for it is not impossible. It also helps that software reviews are a topic where people will always be looking for the latest information&#x2F;newest videos.</p><p>If the search results for your keyword are dominated by monster channels with millions of subs, and you can’t think of an angle you can use to crack into those top results (i.e. having newer information people will be looking for, which the more established videos are lacking), then maybe try the search with your second best keyword and see if there’s a better opportunity for you to rank there.</p><p>One of the biggest benefits of identifying trends and making videos about them quickly is that you can get in before there’s a lot of competition for the first few pages of search results on YouTube or Google, and before larger channels start making videos of their own on the same topic.</p><p>Want to make coming up with YouTube video ideas a habit? <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-come-up-with-better-youtube-video-ideas-391.html" >This post here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will help you develop a process to generate more ideas and properly evaluate them.</p><h2 id="Making-Better-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Making-Better-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Making Better YouTube Videos with Filmora"></a>Making Better YouTube Videos with Filmora</h2><p>As one of the most widely used video editing software among YouTubers, Filmora provides plentiful editing tools, such as cut, trim, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video stabilization <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >noise removal <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >chroma key compositing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and color grading.

YouTube Live Vs. Periscope: What’s the Difference?"></a>Facebook Live Vs. YouTube Live Vs. Periscope: What’s the Difference?</h2><p><strong>1. Audience:</strong></p><p> We all know that Facebook is currently having highest user base so naturally Facebook Live is assumed to have more viewers and streamers. Google considers most of the YouTube content valuable but note that it is YouTube not the recently updated YouTube Live platform. On the other side, if we talk about Periscope then it can be best described as a standalone network. In case if it gets linked to main app YouTube then it may avail some popularity in the market, same as that of Facebook. If you are a beginner then probably, Facebook is the best choice for you as it can provide more audience over the nights. Periscope users can also enjoy healthy content over Mobile phones with great stream quality. One more interesting thing to know about Periscope is that it can be used to develop healthy relationships with so many viewers and followers.</p><p><strong>2. User Interface:</strong></p><p> Here is one more interesting factor to discuss about all these amazing Live streaming platforms. This feature makes a system or software standout among other competitors. If we compare user interface of Facebook Live, Periscope and YouTube Live then you will find them all almost similar. But most of the beginners rate Facebook as most simple and user friendly tool for live broadcasts. Second rating is received by Periscope whereas YouTube Live stands on third level. User interface of Periscope and Facebook live possesses so many similar features such as ability to subscribe, comment or updating likes etc.</p><p><strong>3. Saving Broadcasts and Embedding Replays:</strong></p><p> Let us discuss about saving broadcasts as well as get some idea about their ability to arrange embedding replays. The video archiving ability of YouTube and Facebook is having almost similar kind of features. Users are able to update their live streams and they can also be saved for longer run, even permanently as per need. If you want to delete them then simple controls allow easy removal of updated broadcasts from channel. On the other side, Periscope allows live streamers to stay on channel only for 24 hours. After that, all the updated videos get automatically deleted. On Facebook, users cannot come to know about who is watching their live streams until and unless they receive comments from viewers. Although, Facebook keep on updating notifications about all live streams but more often they create a bug. In case of Periscope, whenever a person starts viewing your uploaded content, his name will directly appear at your end. It can help you to know the real strength of your updates so that you can improve quality of content as per interest of viewers. It is also possible to make private or public settings for broadcasts on Periscope whereas Facebook is gaining more popularity for its Split Screen and 360 videos.</p><p><strong>4. Interaction:</strong></p><p><strong>Communicate with Broadcasters:</strong></p><p> If you want to interact with broadcaster on Facebook then you can simply update your comment or show them your reaction with emojies. They can be updated at the time of live broadcasts as well as at the time of replay. Most of the Facebook users are unhappy with its lag time as broadcasters comment gets published after a delay of 30 seconds. In case of Periscope, viewers are able to just comment on live broadcasts and they can also update a heart for their favourite content. If we compare the lag time of Facebook and Periscope then it is lower for Periscope and people often enjoy instantaneous conversations over this network. The best part is that Viewers can update numbers of hearts even for single broadcast and all of them will get recorded. This feature is not available with Facebook emojies. You will be glad to know that once you have prepared account over YouTube then same details can be used to access Periscope platform.</p><p><strong>Interaction with Viewers:</strong></p><p> Facebook allows broadcasters and viewers to enjoy healthy communication as here talks can be initiated by updating name of the person before writing comment. If you want to communicate with all viewers in more professional manner then Facebook’s name based comment updates are best choices. Note that, facebook allows users to enjoy communicate even when stream has already ended. In case of Periscope, again viewers and broadcasters can enjoy direct name to name comment based conversations.

And it’s to be expected because Youtubers have been making content for way longer than TickTokers.</p><p>For example, MrBeast posted his first video on YouTube in 2012, and it has been about 10 years since he created his content.</p><p><strong>Are Highest-Paid YouTube Stars Always Trending?</strong></p><p>Since the highest-paid YouTubers make so much money, you may think they are always “Trending” on YouTube.</p><p>Sorry to pop your bubble, but they are not.</p><p>The highest-paid YouTubers may have a ton of subscribers, but being in “Trending” is different.</p><p>The most important reason is that the “Trending” part of YouTube shows popular videos in the specific area of the users, so it varies depending upon the user’s location.</p><h2 id="Final-Words-1"><a href="#Final-Words-1" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>The world’s biggest video-sharing platform, YouTube, offers an opportunity to all content creators.</p><p>And those who get on the top strike a fortune without a doubt.</p><p>The top 10 highest-paid YouTubers are listed in this article who are making millions of dollars with their YouTube channel.</p><p>And if you also want to create first-class YouTube videos just like them, try using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for editing your videos before uploading them on YouTube.</p><p>Thanks for reading, folks.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Accelerated-Fortnite-Visualization-Steps"><a href="#Accelerated-Fortnite-Visualization-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Accelerated Fortnite Visualization Steps"></a>Accelerated Fortnite Visualization Steps</h2><h1 id="How-to-Make-Fortnite-Thumbnail-for-Free-and-Easy-in-2024"><a href="#How-to-Make-Fortnite-Thumbnail-for-Free-and-Easy-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Fortnite Thumbnail for Free and Easy in 2024"></a>How to Make Fortnite Thumbnail for Free and Easy in 2024</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Ollie-Mattison"><a href="#Ollie-Mattison" class="headerlink" title="Ollie Mattison"></a>Ollie Mattison</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>To grow a Youtube channel, you need to focus on several different factors and elements. Having an attractive and eye-catching thumbnail is one of those top factors that contribute to the growth of your channel. No matter how good your content is, if you cannot attract users to click on your videos, it will not benefit your channel. In this article, we are going to show you how you can make a Fortnite thumbnail in few simple steps using Filmora X. If you are a content creator and love to make Fortnite videos, then this article will be very helpful for you.</p><p>Filmora has recently introduced a new feature named AI Portrait that uses Artificial Intelligence to remove the background from a portrait or image. This feature doesn’t require any green screen to do that. Filmora also contains a wide range of elements and titles that help you enhance the Thumbnail and make look stunning and eye-catching.</p><hr><p><strong>Step 01:</strong> To start making a Fortnite thumbnail, it is important to have a screenshot of your gameplay. We can make a perfect screenshot using Fortnite Replay Mode. If you have recently played a Fortnite match, you can access its replay under the Career tab. Under the Career tab select Replays.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step1.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 02:</strong> If you are using a console, the game will only store 10 recent gameplays, but if you are using a PC, it will store 100 recent gameplays in this section. From all these gameplays, select the one that you want to use for the Thumbnail. Once you choose gameplay, you can control everything in it. The angle, speed, and camera mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step2.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 03:</strong> For creating a perfect thumbnail, select “Drone Free Camera” mode from the camera mode located on the bottom right corner of the screen. It will allow us to change the angle the way we want. Choose an angle of your choice and take the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step3.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 04:</strong> Open Filmora X, make sure to select the 16:9 screen ratio. Import the screenshot using the import button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step4.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step4"                ></p><p><strong>Step 05:</strong> Drag and drop the screenshot into the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step5.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step5"                ></p><p><strong>Step 06:</strong> Now, let’s separate the background and character. Go to the Effects, then AI Portrait, select Human Segmentation, and drop it into the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step6.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step6"                ></p><p><strong>Step 07:</strong> Filmora will ask you to purchase it, but you can now hit “Try it” to use it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step7.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step7"                ></p><p><strong>Step 08:</strong> It will remove the background of the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step8.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 09:</strong> To add a background, go to the media and navigate to “Sample Color.” Drag a color of your choice and drop it below the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step9.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step9"                ></p><p><strong>Step 10:</strong> To add titles in the Thumbnail, go to the Titles tab. Here you can find several categories of titles. Find your preferred title and drop it above all the layers. You can choose titles, lower thirds, and other texts depending upon your need and requirement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step10.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step10"                ></p><p><strong>Step 11:</strong> We can make this Fortnite Thumbnail look more attractive by adding elements such as stickers and icons. Filmora contains a wide range of stickers. To access them, navigate to the Elements tab. Here you can find so many categories of elements. Choose any elements according to your need and drop them in the timeline above all other layers. If you cannot find a suitable sticker, you can download one from the internet and use it by importing it into Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step11.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step11"                ></p><p><strong>Step 12:</strong> Once you are satisfied with the final results, you can take the screenshot of the Thumbnail using the Snapshot icon located below the preview panel. It will create a screenshot in the media panel of Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step12.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step12"                ></p><p><strong>Step 13:</strong> To access the directory where this screenshot is saved, right-click on the screenshot and click on “Reveal in Explorer.” It will open the folder that contains all the screenshots you take through Filmora. Your Fortnite Thumbnail is ready to be used on your Youtube videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step13.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step13"                ></p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>With Filmora, there are no limits.

With this <strong>YouTube’s speed control</strong>, 1 is the normal speed, with 0.25 being one-quarter (1&#x2F;4th) of the actual speed and slowing the video. In the same vein, 2x is twice the average speed, increasing the video speed.</p><p>However, in as much as <strong>YouTube speed control</strong> slows or speeds up the video, it does not change the pitch of the video. All it does is either expand or compress the video samples while still maintaining the video or audio pitch. It would still sound like the podcaster or video blogger is just talking faster or slower.</p><p>Music would still maintain the same musical key and pitch while playing faster or slower.</p><p>If you are watching a presentation or interview that seems like everyone is talking like they have all the time in the world, you can <strong>fast forward YouTube</strong> video by using the feature.</p><p>Also, you can slow down a tutorial or the video you are watching if you feel they are too fast using this <strong>YouTube speed control</strong>.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>YouTube speed control</strong> has made it easier to change <strong>YouTube playback speed</strong> to either speed up or slow down the video. This enables you to capture important moments or information you may miss if the video was fast. Also, you can save time and get to the information you are searching for as soon as possible by speeding the YouTube video.</p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Change Video Speed with Keyboard Shortcuts on YouTube</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to Change YouTube’s Video Playback Speed on Mobile</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">How YouTube’s Playback Speed Controls Work?</a></p><p>05 <a href="#part5">How to Change a YouTube Video’s Speed Online</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Change-YouTube’s-Playback-Speed-on-Computer-1"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Change-YouTube’s-Playback-Speed-on-Computer-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Change YouTube’s Playback Speed on Computer"></a>Part 1: How to Change YouTube’s Playback Speed on Computer</h2><p>To <strong>fast-forward YouTube</strong> playback videos or slow it down on the computer, you must follow the proper steps.

In this article, we look at how the YPP is changing and the beauty of the YouTube monetization 500 subscribers’ policy update.</p><p><strong>YouTube Shorts Monetization</strong> A cross-platform for helping you present your content in the best way possible<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"                      alt="Free Download"                > <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora 12"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-YouTube-Monetization-Revamp-500-Subscribers-Minimum-Threshold-Unveiled"><a href="#Part-1-YouTube-Monetization-Revamp-500-Subscribers-Minimum-Threshold-Unveiled" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

It is distracting and makes it difficult to engage with the content of a video. If there is noticeable background noise in a video, even a small noise like the faint hum of a computer fan, then it will increase the chances of viewers clicking away. The good news is that these kinds of noises are fairly easy to get rid of.</p><p>In order to remove background noise from your video clip, you will first need to create an MP3 of your audio. Then you will be able to take out the unwanted noise in a free program called Audacity and reintroduce your corrected audio into your Filmora project. This article will walk you through the audio editing process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/remove-background-noise-from-video.jpg"                      alt="remove background noise from video"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Remove-Background-Noise-from-Your-Youtube-Video-1"><a href="#How-To-Remove-Background-Noise-from-Your-Youtube-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="How To Remove Background Noise from Your Youtube Video"></a>How To Remove Background Noise from Your Youtube Video</h2><h3 id="Background-Noise-Removal"><a href="#Background-Noise-Removal" class="headerlink" title="Background Noise Removal"></a>Background Noise Removal</h3><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>Open up Filmora, import your clip, and drag it into the timeline.

Creating An MP3"></a>1.  Creating An MP3</h4><p>If you do not already have it you will need to download VLC Media Player from videoLAN.org. VLC is a completely free media player that can play almost any type of file, is great for converting files, and can even be used as a screen recorder. If you consume a lot of media online then chances are you already have VLC. You could also use is Free Video to MP3 Converter by DVDVideoSoft.</p><p>If you choose to use VLC, open it up and select <strong>Convert&#x2F;Save</strong> under <strong>Media</strong>. Select your video in the <strong>Open Media</strong> window that pops up. After you click <strong>Convert&#x2F;Save</strong> you will be able to choose your format, in this case, MP3, under <strong>Save as type</strong>.</p><h4 id="2-Removing-Background-Noise-in-Audacity"><a href="#2-Removing-Background-Noise-in-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="2.  Removing Background Noise in Audacity"></a>2.  Removing Background Noise in Audacity</h4><p>You can download Audacity for free at Audacityteam.org.</p><p>Once you have Audacity use it to open your MP3. Then, find a section of your audio that is silent aside from your background noise and highlight it by clicking and dragging. The idea is to point out to the program exactly what sound is a problem for you so it knows what to remove. If you have trouble finding a significant stretch of background noise that does not also include dialogue remember to record a pause before or after the content of your video next time you film.</p><p>With your section of background noise highlighted, go to <strong>Effect</strong> and then <strong>Noise Reduction</strong>. Then, click on <strong>Get Noise Profile</strong>. After that, you will select your entire audio timeline before going back to <strong>Noise Reduction</strong> under <strong>Effect</strong>. This time click on <strong>OK</strong> (the default settings are the best in most situations so you do not need to worry about changing them).</p><p>Audacity will remove everything that sounds like the sound profile, eliminating your background noise. Sometimes this method will also dull your dialogue, which can be fixed by selecting your entire track and then going to <strong>Effect</strong> and <strong>Amplify</strong>. Increasing amplification will fix any muffling of your audio.</p><h4 id="3-Syncing-in-Filmora"><a href="#3-Syncing-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="3. Syncing in Filmora"></a>3. Syncing in Filmora</h4><p>Export your corrected MP3 from Audacity and import it into Filmora. Then, drag it into your music track. Syncing your audio should not be difficult, but you can always use your original audio to help you line it up properly if you need to. Just look for a significant spike in your audio waves in both your MP3 and the original audio and make sure they are right on top of each other.</p><p>Then, since you no longer need your original audio, you can delete it. Right-click on your clip and select <strong>Audio Detach</strong>. Once your audio is on its own track just select it and click delete.</p><h3 id="Covering-Background-Noise"><a href="#Covering-Background-Noise" class="headerlink" title="Covering Background Noise"></a>Covering Background Noise</h3><p>Sometimes background noise is so minor that you do not want to bother going through the process of removing it. In these situations, it may be easier to cover up your background noise than to remove it. This is as simple as dragging a song into the music track of your timeline and adjusting its volume so it is not loud enough to draw attention away from your dialogue. Chances are you want to add background music anyways and this is not even an extra step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-gain-1000-followers-on-youtube-with-agile-strategies/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Gain 1,000 Followers on YouTube with Agile Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-how-to-become-a-travel-vlogger-guide-of-travel-vlogging-for-2024/"><u>[New] How To Become A Travel Vlogger | Guide of Travel Vlogging for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-from-casual-follower-to-dedicated-subscriber-inspirational-journey/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, From Casual Follower to Dedicated Subscriber  Inspirational Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-ensuring-authenticity-of-your-youtube-account/"><u>[New] In 2024, Ensuring Authenticity of Your YouTube Account</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-creating-a-viral-traction-with-6-strategic-steps-in-youtube-marketing/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Creating a Viral Traction with 6 Strategic Steps in YouTube Marketing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-from-bland-to-brilliant-transform-your-youtube-channels-image/"><u>[New] In 2024, From Bland to Brilliant  Transform Your YouTube Channels' Image</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-find-a-niche-market-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  How to Find A Niche Market on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-breaking-the-mold-how-to-create-a-standout-youtube-channel-name/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Breaking the Mold  How to Create a Standout YouTube Channel Name</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-heres-how-you-can-ace-the-tiktok-photo-editing-hacks/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Here’s How You Can Ace the TikTok Photo Editing Hacks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/understanding-the-mechanics-behind-googles-podcast-application-for-2024/"><u>Understanding the Mechanics Behind Googles Podcast Application for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-complete-tutorial-to-use-gps-joystick-to-fake-gps-location-on-oneplus-ace-2-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Complete Tutorial to Use GPS Joystick to Fake GPS Location On OnePlus Ace 2 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/solved-warning-camera-failed-on-samsung-galaxy-f15-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Solved Warning Camera Failed on Samsung Galaxy F15 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-deconstructing-the-revenue-stream-of-tseries-in-youtube-economy/"><u>[New] In 2024, Deconstructing the Revenue Stream of TSeries in YouTube Economy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/step-by-step-process-disabling-video-sound-in-latest-mkv-format-mkv-2023/"><u>Step-by-Step Process Disabling Video Sound in Latest MKV Format (MKV-2023)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-key-15-low-fee-screen-recording-tools-for-windowsmac/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Key 15 Low-Fee Screen Recording Tools for Windows/Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-streamlining-your-youtube-vids-for-igtv-adoption/"><u>In 2024, Streamlining Your YouTube Vids for IGTV Adoption</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-top-5-android-apps-that-use-fingerprint-sensor-to-lock-your-apps-on-infinix-note-30-vip-racing-edition-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, The Top 5 Android Apps That Use Fingerprint Sensor to Lock Your Apps On Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It is to see from these statistics why every video aspiring YouTubers post on their channels has to be perfect in every way in order to reach a wide audience. Fortunately, trimming a video even after you’ve uploaded it to YouTube is a quick and easy process, and in this article, we are going to show you a few different methods you can use to trim the videos you upload to YouTube.

This is good news for all video creators who frequently update their YouTube videos after they upload them, as they no longer have to go through the endless uploads just because they wanted to trim a video.</p><p>Make sure that you’re signed into your YouTube channel, then click on your <strong>profile picture</strong> and select the <strong>YouTube Studio (Beta)</strong> option. On the left side of the screen, you’ll be able to see a menu that contains different subcategories like <strong>Analytics, Dashboard or Videos</strong>, so just click on the <strong>Videos</strong> option and proceed to select a video you’d like to trim. After the Videos submenu appears on the screen you should click on the <strong>Editor</strong> option and the video you selected will open in the YouTube’s video editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-editor-youtube-studio.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube videos after uploading"                ></p><p>Click on the <strong>Trim button</strong> to start trimming the video and drag the <strong>blue bars</strong> located at the start and the end of the file to designate the portion of the video you’d like to remove.

Filmora video editing software for PC and Mac computers offers a few different tools for trimming videos. After you’ve created a new project in Filmora, you should import a video clip into the editor by clicking on the <strong>Import</strong> drop-down menu and select the <strong>Import Media Files</strong> option. Each file you add to a project will be displayed in the <strong>Media tab</strong>, and you can just <strong>drag and drop</strong> it to a video track on the timeline.</p><p>All you have to do in order to trim a video after you’ve placed it on the timeline is drag <strong>one of its ends to the left or to the right</strong>. As you drag one of the clip’s edges the editor will only display <strong>the remaining footage</strong> while rendering the rest invisible. If at any point you want to access a portion of the video you’ve trimmed you just have to <strong>extend the file by dragging it</strong> until you’re able to see the segment you’re searching for.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/trim-sides.gif"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Trimmer  Tool"                ></p><h4 id="Method-2-Using-Filmora-Split-Tool"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Filmora-Split-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using Filmora Split Tool"></a>Method 2: Using Filmora Split Tool</h4><p>Filmora’s <strong>Split tool</strong> can help you separate the portion of the clip you want to remove from the segment you’d like to keep. Simply <strong>place the playhead</strong> at the exact location in the video clip where you want to make <strong>a cut</strong>, and click on the <strong>Split icon</strong> that looks like a pair of scissors. After the video is split, you should click on the clip you no longer need in order to select it and then hit the <strong>Delete</strong> button on your keyboard to remove it from the timeline.</p><h4 id="Method-3-Using-Scene-Detection"><a href="#Method-3-Using-Scene-Detection" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Using Scene Detection"></a>Method 3: Using Scene Detection</h4><p>Wondershare’s video editor also offers an <strong>automatic way to split a video</strong> clip into a number of separate scenes. <strong>Right-click</strong> on the video file located in the Filmora’s Media tab, and select the <strong>Scene Detection</strong> option from the menu and proceed to click on the <strong>Detect button</strong>, after the <strong>Scene Detection window</strong> pops up on the screen. The software will then <strong>automatically analyze the footage</strong> and divide it into separate scenes. Simply click on the <strong>Add to Timeline button</strong> once the process is completed to continue editing the video clip you’ve just split.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/scene-detection-interface.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Scene Detection Tool"                ></p><h4 id="Method-4-Using-Instant-Cutter-Tool"><a href="#Method-4-Using-Instant-Cutter-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Using Instant Cutter Tool"></a>Method 4: Using Instant Cutter Tool</h4><p>The <strong>Instant Cutter Tool</strong> enables you to quickly trim or merge high-resolution files recorded on action cameras as soon as you import them into a project in Filmora. Select the <strong>Import with Instant Cutter Tool option</strong> from the <strong>Import drop-down menu</strong> and wait for the <strong>Filmora Instant Cutter</strong> window to appear on the screen. In the upper left corner of this window, you will be able to see <strong>Trim and Merge tabs</strong>. Make sure that the <strong>Trim tab</strong> is selected and then click on the <strong>Open File button</strong> to import a video clip you’d like to trim. You can then use <strong>the trimming sliders</strong> to designate the parts of the video you’d like to remove or the set the <strong>In and Out points</strong> by clicking on the <strong>Set In Point or Set Out Point icons</strong>. Click on the <strong>Export button</strong> to save the new version of the video clip and <strong>click OK</strong> to complete the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instant-cutter-filmora-1.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Instant Cutter Tool"                ></p><h2 id="Using-Online-Video-Editing-Platforms-to-Trim-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Using-Online-Video-Editing-Platforms-to-Trim-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Using Online Video Editing Platforms to Trim YouTube Videos"></a>Using Online Video Editing Platforms to Trim YouTube Videos</h2><p>In case you’re looking for a tool that lets you save extracts of scenes from YouTube to your computer free of charge <a class="link"   href="https://ytcutter.com/" >YT Cutter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> may be one of your best options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/yt-cutter-youtube-trimmer.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos online"                ></p><p>This online video editing platform is remarkably easy to use since you just have to <strong>copy</strong> <strong>the link to the YouTube video</strong> you’d like to trim into <strong>YT Cutter’s URL box</strong> and then select how long the new video should be.

Two of the main platforms are YouTube and Vimeo. This article tells you the difference between both so that you can decide which the best platform is for you. Whether you are a marketer, video producer or gamer you will find the information useful to find your target audience easily.</p><p>Also read:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Full Review of Vimeo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Vimeo Basic, Vimeo Plus or Vimeo Pro: Which is Right for You? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Please watch the video below for more information:</p><h2 id="Detailed-View-of-YouTube-and-Vimeo"><a href="#Detailed-View-of-YouTube-and-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="Detailed View of YouTube and Vimeo"></a>Detailed View of YouTube and Vimeo</h2><h4 id="1-Communities"><a href="#1-Communities" class="headerlink" title="1  Communities"></a>1  Communities</h4><p><strong>YouTube:</strong> When it comes to users YouTube comes out on top with over a billion views each and every month. You are able to interact with your viewers by using the comments and people are able to follow you so that they are notified of new videos and comments. As there is already a huge following on YouTube it’s easy to get a good following if you have great content. It’s harder to control public content which is a downside to using YouTube and there is very little customer support. With the comments being moderated rarely it can cause a distraction from your video. Businesses tend to internally block YouTube video’s which means you won’t get the viewings from people on their lunch breaks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-vs-youtube-communities.jpg"                      alt="vimeo-vs-youtube-communities"                ></p><p><strong>Vimeo:</strong> With higher quality content and no advertisements video owners can quickly build a valid following and gain comments from people that are contributing high value information. You have more detailed analytics which makes it easier to see where you are going wrong should you not have the following you want and you are able to use your own domain. With Google owning YouTube you are unlikely to get the same exposure you would, however the followers tend to be valid giving you a real idea of where you are going right or wrong. Because of the higher quality followers you are less likely to get negative or abusive comments when you use Vimeo, however it is a paid subscription with each tier giving you more space to upload.</p><h4 id="2-Membership"><a href="#2-Membership" class="headerlink" title="2  Membership"></a>2  Membership</h4><p><strong>YouTube:</strong> YouTube on the other hand is free for all to use because the main focus is getting their equity through advertisements. There is however the option to take out a subscription which is known as YouTube Red. This lets you watch as many video’s as you want without having to view the ads and also gets you the ability to download so you don’t have to go online to view your favourite videos, a music app and original programming facilities.</p><p><strong>Vimeo:</strong> There are 4 different membership options with Vimeo allowing you to tailor it to your needs; there is the basic, plus, pro and business.

This is great news if you are a marketer as it will allow you to reach out to viewers on video’s that are relevant to your brand&#x2F;product&#x2F;service, however for those that are viewing the sheer amount of ads can be off-putting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-advertising.jpg"                      alt="youtube-advertising"                ></p><p><strong>Vimeo:</strong> As a paid subscription service and even the limited free package, you won’t have to view or show viewers ads, which means that your videos are more likely to be seen in their entirety not abandoned due to advertisements.</p><h4 id="4-Updating-video"><a href="#4-Updating-video" class="headerlink" title="4  Updating video"></a>4  Updating video</h4><p><strong>YouTube:</strong> If you upload videos to YouTube you do not have the same benefits as the only way to amend a video is to take it down, delete it and re-upload a new one. This unfortunately takes with it any statistics such as views that you have gained. If you do choose YouTube for your videos then do make sure you check everything vigorously before you upload it as there’s no way to change it.</p><p><strong>Vimeo:</strong> Occasionally an uploaded video may need some changes made. This could be due to changes to the offer you have or you have noticed something else that needs amending. With Vimeo if you need to update a video you can do so without losing the statistics it has already gained, which is great news if you notice an error later down the line or need to add or take something away.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-uploading.jpg"                      alt="vimeo-uploading"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>When it comes down to making the final decision between using YouTube or Vimeo you will need to look at the type of audience you want to attract. With Vimeo you are more likely to attract creators and film makers, whereas with YouTube you will have a bigger audience to target which gives you a better chance of a higher rank on search engines.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-flip-the-script-on-classic-films-7-list/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Flip the Script on Classic Films, #7 List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-fuel-the-fire-top-videos-that-inspire-audiences/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Fuel the Fire  Top Videos That Inspire Audiences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-grasp-the-basics-of-sub4sub-success-our-guide-lays-it-out-clearly/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Grasp the Basics of Sub4sub Success - Our Guide Lays It Out Clearly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-buzzing-tracks-ultimate-backdrops-for-youtube-shorts-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Buzzing Tracks  Ultimate Backdrops for YouTube Shorts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-harmonizing-cityscapes-and-nature-the-role-of-green-spaces-for-2024/"><u>[New] Harmonizing Cityscapes and Nature  The Role of Green Spaces for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-how-to-convert-youtubes-audios-to-mp3-safely-step-by-step-guide-for-2024/"><u>[New] How To Convert YouTube's Audios to MP3 Safely - Step-by-Step Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-force-youtube-cc-to-stay-on-and-get-more-views/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, How to Force YouTube CC to Stay On and Get More Views</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-from-novice-to-expert-mastering-video-identity-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  From Novice to Expert  Mastering Video Identity on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/your-gateway-to-greatness-making-your-mark-with-mac-made-vids-for-2024/"><u>Your Gateway to Greatness  Making Your Mark with Mac-Made Vids for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-enhancing-chrome-performance-for-hd-facebook-content/"><u>[New] Enhancing Chrome Performance for HD Facebook Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-list-of-windows-10-webcam-recorders-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Ultimate List of Windows 10 Webcam Recorders for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/making-your-twitter-videos-dance-convert-them-into-expressive-animated-gifs/"><u>Making Your Twitter Videos Dance  Convert Them Into Expressive Animated GIFs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/downloading-samfw-frp-tool-30-for-honor-magic-5-pro-by-drfone-android/"><u>Downloading SamFw FRP Tool 3.0 for Honor Magic 5 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-perfecting-mp4-segments-best-tools-for-mac-filmmakers/"><u>2024 Approved  Perfecting MP4 Segments  Best Tools For Mac Filmmakers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/3-steps-for-perfect-instagram-video-margins-for-2024/"><u>3 Steps for Perfect Instagram Video Margins for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-transforming-brand-stories-with-client-produced-testimonials/"><u>[New] Transforming Brand Stories with Client-Produced Testimonials</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-easy-steps-to-record-your-dell-laptops-display/"><u>2024 Approved  Easy Steps to Record Your Dell Laptop's Display</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

For most, it’s a way to scratch a creative itch, to enjoy being in front of an audience and as an outlet for their talents and opinions. However, the potential to make money on YouTube is huge, and eventually any busy channel is going to start asking itself, how do YouTubers make money?</p><p>This subject is less about ‘if’ you can make money and more about how to make money on YouTube. It’s been proven time and again that the potential is there, with popular stars like Lily Singh and Roman Atwood generating around $8 million a year. And, of course, everyone’s heard of PewDiePie and his whopping $15 million income.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/top-earning-youtubers.jpg"                      alt="youtubers"                ></p><p>You don’t need to have a following of millions to earn money on YouTube though; even small channels have a variety of methods available to them to start making their hard work pay. If you’d like to learn how to make money on YouTube, we’re going to look at eight ways of generating an income via your videos. Let’s get started.</p><h2 id="How-to-make-money-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-make-money-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to make money on YouTube"></a>How to make money on YouTube</h2><ul><li><a href="#part1">Make money on YouTube with ads</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Make money on YouTube without ads</a></li></ul><p>We’ve discovered that making money on YouTube can be split into two main categories; making money through advertising or making money without ads involved. We’ve split our article into these two categories to make it easier for you to see what your options are.</p><h3 id="Make-money-on-YouTube-with-ads"><a href="#Make-money-on-YouTube-with-ads" class="headerlink" title="Make money on YouTube with ads"></a>Make money on YouTube with ads</h3><p>By far the easiest way to start earning money on YouTube is to monetize your channel using ads. Until relatively recently, anyone could enable monetization on their YouTube channel and start earning for every watch of their video. But that all changed in January this year, when Google announced they would be raising the standards required to have ads shown on your channel.</p><p>Now, you need to be part of the YouTube Partner Program (YPP), which means you need to have met certain minimum criteria before you can start benefitting from ads. These include:</p><ul><li>Having 4,000 or more watch hours</li><li>Securing 1,000 or more subscribers in the last 12 months</li></ul><p>This means that, before you can even consider being a part of the YPP, you’ll need to knuckle down and grow your subscribers. There’s lots of helpful tips out there on increasing subscriber numbers, but it all boils down to creating excellent content. As they say, ‘if you build it, they will come’, so work on creating new and exciting content for your channel to get where you need to be.</p><h4 id="Should-you-join-YouTube-partner-or-not"><a href="#Should-you-join-YouTube-partner-or-not" class="headerlink" title="Should you join YouTube partner or not?"></a>Should you join YouTube partner or not?</h4><p>Meeting the minimum requirements of the YPP is crucial to starting to host ads, but even when you’ve hit the 1k subscribers and 4k hours viewed, should you be monetizing your channel right away? Put it this way; in order to make any money from ads, you’re going to need a lot of views and loyal subscribers, which means your focus needs to be firmly on creating content rather than complying with advertising rules.</p><p>Sometimes it’s actually better to hold off for a while when you’re early on in your YouTube journey. This will mean that, rather than being distracted by the question of how to earn money from YouTube, your energy is targeted at what matters most, which is building up a library of awesome videos instead.</p><h4 id="How-to-Join-the-YouTube-Partner-Platform"><a href="#How-to-Join-the-YouTube-Partner-Platform" class="headerlink" title="How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform?"></a>How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform?</h4><p>1.

Compared to a lot of the “Terms” you are asked to read and agree to when signing up for things online the Partner Terms are fairly short and readable.</p><p>5. After reading the terms there are three boxes you will need to check to proceed. The first is to confirm that you read the Terms. The second box is a promise not to click on the ads in your own videos to try to create profits artificially.</p><p>The third box requires you to promise not monetize content that you do not own. The most extreme version of this would be stealing somebody else’s video and trying to monetize it on your channel. However, using a song or sound effect in your video you do not have the rights to also counts. There are a lot of places you can get free music to use in your monetized videos, and YouTube’s own Audio Library is one of them.</p><p>6. After you have checked all the boxes and moved on you will see a pop up explaining how to monetize your individual videos.</p><p>Your channel is now monetized, but you will not be able to earn money until you have linked your channel to your AdSense account.</p><p>7.

You must also specify here if you have included paid product placement in your video.</p><p>14. Wait for the review process to finish and ads to start appearing in your videos. If you are using any licensed, royalty free, content (like a music track) then YouTube may ask you to prove you have the rights to it.</p><h4 id="How-much-you-can-get-from-Ads"><a href="#How-much-you-can-get-from-Ads" class="headerlink" title="How much you can get from Ads"></a>How much you can get from Ads</h4><p>The ad revenue generated on YouTube is split between Google and you. You’ll get 55 per cent and Google &#x2F; YouTube will take the remaining 45 per cent. This means that, if an advertiser spends $200 on your channel, you could be earning $110 directly. You’ll earn both for ‘impressions’, which is the number of views the ad received, and ‘click throughs’, which is when someone clicks on the ad for more information.</p><p>Be aware that, in order to get paid, your audience will need to have viewed at least 30 seconds of the ad, or to have clicked through to the advertiser. As a rule, around 15 per cent of viewers will convert into ad revenue, so you can start to calculate just how much your video could be worth.</p><p>To give you an example, if you enjoy daily video views in the region of 3,000 views per day and achieve click through &#x2F; view rates of the average 15 per cent, you’d be earning $0.85 - $1.40 per day or $25 - $43 a month for that one video. If you could increase your views to 5,000 per day, your monthly earnings would rise to $41 - $70 per month.</p><p>When working out how to make money on YouTube, keep in mind that every single video has the potential to earn you money. Although one video might only make a dollar a day, imagine when you’ve got 10 videos performing to the same standard, or 100. As you build up your library of content, you have the potential to earn exponentially more as time goes on.</p><p>Want to know how much you can get from Ads?

In order to get more and better brands advertising in your space, you’ll need to make sure you’ve done all that you can to make your channel attractive to them.</p><ol><li><strong>Target a specific demographic</strong></li></ol><p>Your advertisers want to place their products in front of a very specific audience, so the more embedded in your niche your videos are, the more likely you are to attract investment. If you try to be all things to all people, advertisers are going to see that you’re a risky prospect and will move on to a channel that’s more targeted.</p><p>To check demographics, YouTube has everything already there for you. In the YouTube Studio, you’ll find the exact demographics of your audience profile, including age, country of origin and gender. You can see how appealing your videos are to the people you are targeting by checking the spread of representation here.</p><ol><li><strong>Pay attention to your video metadata</strong></li></ol><p>YouTube metadata is an often-overlooked element of content that is actually incredibly important, both for advertising revenue and for views in general. What we mean when we talk about metadata is your tags, title and description of your video, all of which should make use of high traffic keywords that you’ve researched as being relevant.</p><p>YouTube’s own keyword suggestion tool can be a great place to start finding those golden keywords that will get you noticed. Advertisers often use your metadata to locate videos that their customers are watching, so SEO is crucial here. Not only that, but when viewers are looking for new videos to watch, the SEO of your metadata will define where in the search results you fall, so putting some time and energy into this can get you more views too.</p><ol><li><strong>Avoid dodgy video content</strong></li></ol><p>There are some types of content which are just not a good idea for YouTube. In fact, the platform could exclude you from advertising altogether if your content is found to contain any of the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Sexually suggestive content</strong>: This includes making jokes based around sexual topics, as well as partial nudity of anyone in the video.</li><li><strong>Violence</strong>: This ranges from topics of extremism to videos of people sustaining serious injuries, as well as threats and suggestions of violence.</li><li><strong>Inappropriate language</strong>: Even the most popular YouTubers have started bleeping out their profanities, so avoid vulgar language or anything that could be construed as being threatening.</li><li><strong>Drugs</strong>: Promotion of the use, sale or abuse of drugs and other controlled substances is forbidden.</li><li><strong>Sensitive</strong> <strong>subjects</strong>: This includes references to wars, race crimes, natural disasters, political conflicts, even if you don’t show images of the situation itself.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flagged-content-on-youtube.jpg"                      alt="flagged content"                ></p><p>When you’re considering how do YouTubers make money, you should recognize that those who make the most money avoid creating content that breaches any of these rules. YouTube does notify you if it feels your video is in breach of ‘advertiser friendly’ policies, and you’ll have the chance to contest the ban, but if you steer clear of dodgy content in the first place you shouldn’t run into any issues.</p><h3 id="Make-money-on-YouTube-without-ads"><a href="#Make-money-on-YouTube-without-ads" class="headerlink" title="Make money on YouTube without ads"></a>Make money on YouTube without ads</h3><p>Of course, life is not all about ads, and with YouTube continuing to tighten its criteria around advertising it can be a good idea not to have all your eggs in one basket. Add to this the huge viewership you’re going to need in order to make serious money, it’s worth investigating other methods of making money on YouTube. Here are some of the best ideas.</p><ol><li><strong>Work with brands</strong></li></ol><p>Influencer marketing is big business right now, and brands all over the world are investing in individuals who have secured the loyalty and trust of their target demographic. Sponsored videos might feature product placement, promoting a product from your sponsor, or you may be asked to produce a particular piece of content to support their campaign. Check out influencer marketplaces like Famebit, Grapevine Logic and Crowdtap to see what’s available to you. If you want to make work with brands, you can check out <a class="link"   href="https://www.influenex.com/" >InflueNex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a powerful influencer marketing platform, which will help you to build good relationship with brands.</p><ol><li><strong>Selling products or merchandise</strong></li></ol><p>Selling ‘merch’ is a great way to discover how to earn money from YouTube. T-shirts, tote bags, mugs, hats…whatever fits with you and your brand can become an amazing source of revenue for your business. Not only does this increase your exposure as a brand by putting it out there into the non-YouTube world, it also gives your fans a way to literally buy into what you’re doing.</p><ol><li><strong>Affiliate marketing</strong></li></ol><p>Affiliate marketing doesn’t have to be hard work or complicated. Registering with big sales platforms such as Amazon is often as simple as filling out a couple of forms. Once registered, you can use your own special links to hook your viewers up with a product that you would recommend, and you’ll get a proportion of the final sale value. It’s not only Amazon who offer affiliate programs; most major brands will offer some kind of sales commission, so if you’re in a niche that calls for specialist products to promote, do contact brands directly to find out what they can offer.</p><ol><li><strong>Crowdfund</strong></li></ol><p>If you’ve got an amazingly creative idea but lack of funds is stopping you from putting it into action, crowdfunding could be the way to go. Crowdfunded projects can use the money they make to buy better production equipment, hire people to work on the project, pay for props, anything really. A good way to get started with crowdfunding a particular idea is to create a ‘trailer’ or sneak peek that gives people a better idea of what you want to do. Make sure it gets them so excited that they can’t help but donate to your cause!</p><ol><li><strong>Renting out your video</strong></li></ol><p>You have the ability to rent out individual videos for cold, hard cash, just like a pay per view service. The options for this are in the Creator Studio, where you can set the amount you want to rent it out for as well as creating an enticing trailer to encourage people to buy. Choose to either sell your video permanently, letting the person view it whenever they like, or rent for a limited time, usually 24 to 72 hours.</p><ol><li><strong>License your content to the media</strong></li></ol><p>If you’re lucky enough to make a video that goes viral, you can make serious bucks by licensing it to the wider media. From online news sites to TV shows, there are loads of other content creators out there willing to pay good money to use your amazing clip, and may will reach out to you directly with offers. You can also proactively offer your content for sale via sites like Juken Media, where others can find it and purchase it directly.</p><p>Now you know how to earn money from YouTube, what are you going to try?

As a content creator, you go toiling several processes to ensure its success. More so, you are probably building a brand and want people to know about your product or services. What about one easy way to remember the URL and share it with your potential subscribers? Besides sending such links to people, you’ll be reminding them to subscribe with just a click.

However, some reasons may contribute to that. You may have realized that YouTube just subscribed you to random channels without asking you. Here are the possible reasons for that.</p><p>• Spinoff Channel<br>A content creator may decide to come up with a Spinoff channel. In this case, they may automatically subscribe you to their new channel. In most cases, such content creators want to promote their new channel.</p><p>• Check your extensions<br>One of your browsers may be playing tricks on your YouTube account. Extensions may change your browser’s settings and make the “Unsubscribe” option unavailable. Try disabling all of your browser extensions, then check back if YouTube still subscribes you to channels unknown to you. If so, solve the issue by uninstalling the specific extensions. These could be ad blockers or free VPN extensions.</p><p>• Someone else can hit the button<br>Do you share your computer with other fellows? The chances are that someone hit the “Subscribe” button without your consent. Just unsubscribe and keep watching next time.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>● The internet arena is very competitive.

Your call-to-action buttons should be related to the video and should make sense to the viewer.</p><ul><li><strong>Consistency</strong></li></ul><p>Being consistent in your designs is a key ingredient to improving your brand recognition.

The number of gamers is growing every day, and that means more and more people are looking for content from experienced gamers on YouTube and Twitch. To produce great YouTube gaming videos, you’ll need a lot of gaming knowledge and a few pieces of high-quality equipment, including a good headset. Without a headset, it might be hard to keep track of in-game audio cues while entertaining your audience.</p><p>Most hardware manufacturers are actively targeting the gaming market, releasing specialized headset models for 2024. Here is a quick overview of the five best candidates for the title of the best gaming headset for 2024:</p><p> <strong><a href="#razer">1. Razer Man O’War 7.1</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="#audiotech">2. Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Open Air High Fidelity Headset</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="#logitec">3. Logitec Surround Sound Gaming Headset G430</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="#kraken">4. Razer Kraken 7.1 Chroma Gaming Headset</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="#hyper">5. HyperX Cloud II Gaming Headset</a></strong></p><h2 id="1-Razer-Man-O’-War-7-1"><a href="#1-Razer-Man-O’-War-7-1" class="headerlink" title="**1. Razer Man O’ War 7.1"></a>**1. Razer Man O’ War 7.1</h2><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/razer-man-headset1.jpg"                      alt="Razer Man O&#39;War 7.1 Headset"                ></strong></p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $222.48</p><p><strong>Compatible with:</strong> PC, Mac (with USB), PlayStation, Xbox</p><p>This wireless headset has an impressive surround sound engine that allows for an immersive gaming experience and convincing positional audio. The headset features a modern ergonomic design with earcups that fit very tightly and completely seal off the outside world. Razer Man O’War looks bulky, but it weighs just over 330 grams and uses an analog 3.5 mm connector.</p><p>The microphone boom extends from the left ear cup and can be easily adjusted or retracted. Most importantly, microphone controls are very sophisticated allowing for in-game switching between channels without disruption. When used for talking, the microphone will ensure absolute clarity, which comes handy for those who broadcast their games on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Wireless setup for maximum freedom</p><p>   <strong>-</strong> Minimizes ambient noise with cushion-like ear cups</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Lightweight and comfortable to wear</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Fully retractable, high-quality MEMS microphone</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Long-lasting batteries – up to 14 hours</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Occasional loss of connectivity</p><p>   <strong>-</strong> Slightly expensive for a plastic build</p><h2 id="2-Audio-Technica-ATH-ADG1-Open-Air-High-Fidelity-Headset"><a href="#2-Audio-Technica-ATH-ADG1-Open-Air-High-Fidelity-Headset" class="headerlink" title="**2. Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Open Air High Fidelity Headset"></a>**2. Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Open Air High Fidelity Headset</h2><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-technica-headset2.jpg"                      alt="Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Headset"                ></strong></p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $299</p><p><strong>Compatible with:</strong> PC, PS4, iPad, iPhone, Xbox (with adapter)</p><p>For a gaming headset, this model boasts a really impressive audio quality. This characteristic is a huge strength, especially when coupled with its broad compatibility and innovative design. The structure of this headset is unique, with an open-air setup that allows for the circulation of air under the set, which is useful during long gaming sessions. This comes at a price since the isolation against ambient noise is less than perfect and the feeling might be a bit awkward until you get used to it.</p><p>As for the microphone, it is permanently attached to the left side of the headset with a flexible stem, so it can be easily adjusted to the desired position. This implies that ATH-ADG1 was made specifically for those who need to communicate while receiving the high-quality audio feed, such as gaming streamers.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Extremely light and uniquely built for comfort</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Top-notch audio quality above its class</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Innovative, self-adjusting frame</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Comfortable ear cups</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>   <strong>-</strong> Analog headset, so the quality depends on the connected device</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Specialized product with a narrow range of applications</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Fragile build that can easily be damaged</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Very expensive</p><h2 id="3-Logitec-Surround-Sound-Gaming-Headset-G430"><a href="#3-Logitec-Surround-Sound-Gaming-Headset-G430" class="headerlink" title="**3. Logitec Surround Sound Gaming Headset G430"></a>**3. Logitec Surround Sound Gaming Headset G430</h2><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logitec-gaming-headset3.jpg"                      alt="Logitec G430 Headset"                ></strong></p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $79.99</p><p><strong>Compatible with:</strong> PC, PS4</p><p>Logitec is well known for producing high-quality peripherals, and this model lives up to that standard despite its affordable price. Its most touted feature is the surround sound system, which is not common in this price range. This allows for very realistic in-game audio, particularly because the headset has an excellent bass channel. In addition to solid audio performance, the Logitec gaming headset is characterized by low weight rotating ear cups with a protective cloth and vibrant coloring.</p><p>A standard 3.5 mm connector is used for the microphone, which is conveniently positioned and capable of clearly capturing speech while blocking out other sounds. Unfortunately, the microphone can’t be easily manipulated and doesn’t offer the option to be muted automatically, although a manual switch is available to turn it off. For a budget gaming headset, that’s a fair compromise.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Realistic, immersive sound</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Smart design optimized to decrease weight</p><p> <strong>-</strong> The Durable cloth covering the ear cups</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Surround effect on a cheap gaming headset</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Excellent price-to-quality ratio</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Lack of programmable commands</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Poor protection against ambient noise</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Less than impressive visually</p><h2 id="4-Razer-Kraken-7-1-Chroma-Gaming-Headset"><a href="#4-Razer-Kraken-7-1-Chroma-Gaming-Headset" class="headerlink" title="**4. Razer Kraken 7.1 Chroma Gaming Headset"></a>**4. Razer Kraken 7.1 Chroma Gaming Headset</h2><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/razer-kraken-headset4.jpg"                      alt="Razer Kraken Chroma Headset"                ></strong></p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $96.77</p><p><strong>Compatible with</strong> <strong>:</strong> PC, PS4</p><p>If you are looking for the best gaming headset with a microphone, this is a very b candidate. It is pretty affordable compared to the other Razer headset on this list (the Man O’ War), but it is equally robust when it comes to performance, including high-quality surround audio. This is a rather large headset with thick ear cups decorated with a glowing logo of the brand, but its size is not a problem since Kraken is very comfortable even when worn continually for hours.</p><p>Kraken’s fully retractable and flexible microphone can be hidden under the left cup when not in use, giving this model a bit of versatility. It picks up your voice even when it’s bent sideways, so YouTube professionals won’t have to worry about the exact positioning while engaged in a fierce battle. It’s also possible to use a toggle switch to mute the microphone quickly.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Excellent audio for its price range</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Surround audio contributes to the more complete gaming experience</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Completely isolates any ambient sounds</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Flexible mic that can be moved out of the way</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Access to Synapse 2.0 software</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> USB only, no 3.5 mm jacks</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Lack of preset settings for gaming</p><p> <strong>-</strong> A sensitive microphone that sometimes picks up unwanted sounds</p><h2 id="5-HyperX-Cloud-II-Gaming-Headset"><a href="#5-HyperX-Cloud-II-Gaming-Headset" class="headerlink" title="**5. HyperX Cloud II Gaming Headset"></a>**5.

It comes with optional surround audio that can be plugged in via sound card, or disconnected when this effect is not needed. The headset was originally designed to work perfectly on the Xbox, but it retains compatibility with most desktops, laptops, and consoles.</p><p>The detachable microphone is very solid and particularly effective in filtering noise and eliminating echo. It can be easily moved into any position or removed altogether when the headset is used for any purpose other than game streaming.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> b and elegant aluminum frame</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Advanced audio control box</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Virtual 7.1 surround audio</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Interchangeable ear pads</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Premium look and feel at an affordable price</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Inconveniently positioned mute switch</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Relatively short cord limiting movement</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Editing-Software-for-Gamers-Wondershare-Filmora9"><a href="#Best-Video-Editing-Software-for-Gamers-Wondershare-Filmora9" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editing Software for Gamers- Wondershare Filmora9"></a>Best Video Editing Software for Gamers- Wondershare Filmora9</h2><p>No doubt gamers would need a lot of effects and overlays to edit a live stream video to show the best effects on the game screen. High bass music syncing with the scene is very important for a game video. The sky is the limit to add effects and background to the game videos with Wondershare Filmora9 as it’s the best video editor for professionals and newcomers who are interested in gaming and pursuing a YouTube channel.

The charismatic vlogger first joined YouTube on August 13, 2017, and uploaded his first gaming video on January 2018. Initially, Ujjwal used his elder brother’s phone to post gaming tutorial videos. This obviously limited his input on YouTube as he also had to set aside time for studying.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-2.jpg"                      alt="techno gamerz youtube marketing"                ></p><p>But after seeing potential in what Techno Gamerz was doing, his brother encouraged him to post more often. His first viral video was for Dragon Ball Z, a downloading tutorial. This video garnered a massive 250K views, boosting his channel’s profile. The young YouTube star has never looked back since then.</p><p>Meantime, you must be asking yourself how YouTube generates income in India. It’s simple; via AdSense! YouTube’s RPM (Revenue Per Mile) metric per 1,000 views varies between countries. In India, the video-sharing platform pays $0.50 per 1,000 views. This means that Indian YouTube teachers and influencers can earn $500 after garnering 1 million views.</p><p>But nothing is cast in stone on YouTube. Most Indian channels can earn between $800 and $2,500 after reaching 1 million views. However, this depends on where you get the most views from. For example, if at least half of your views are from the US, you’ll earn at least $1,500. <strong>Techno Gamerz YouTube income</strong> per 1,000 views is approximately $1.21.</p><p>Remember that there are some conditions to meet before you start earning money on YouTube. First, the channel must be active for at least a year and have a minimum of 1,000 subscribers. That’s not all; you’ll need nothing less than 4,000 watch hours to be on YouTube’s payroll.</p><p>With that said, below are some YouTube stats about the <strong>Techno Gamerz monthly income</strong>, number of views, and more:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Estimated Monthly earnings in USD&#x2F;Indian rupees</th><th>$167K</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Estimated Yearly earnings in USD&#x2F;Indian rupees</td><td>$8.6 million</td></tr><tr><td>Total video uploads</td><td>858</td></tr><tr><td>Type of videos</td><td>Gaming tutorials</td></tr><tr><td>Subscribers</td><td>29 million</td></tr><tr><td>Video views</td><td>7.5 billion</td></tr><tr><td>Last 30 days’ views</td><td>7 million</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As expected, Ujjwal Chaurasia has a massive following on other social media platforms, especially on Instagram. Here, the 20-year-old has more than 2 million followers and over 250K likes on “ujjwalgamer.” He usually posts selfies, pictures, and a few gaming contents on Instagram.
