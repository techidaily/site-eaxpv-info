It entails how exactly the bits are used while encoding the information in a digital storage medium.</p><p> So, a video file format is basically a type of file format in order to store the digital data of a video in the computer system. Mostly, video is often stored using the lossy compression in order to reduce the file size.</p><p><strong>Frame Rate</strong></p><p> “Frame rate” essentially entails the frequency (rate) at which the simultaneous images display on the screen. These images or called “frames”. Frame rate is expressed in “frames per second or FPS”. The unit or term is applicable for film, cameras, motion capture, video, and computer graphics. This is also known as “frame frequency”, expressed in the unit “hertz”</p><p><strong>Resolution</strong></p><p> Resolution is a measure to entail the clarity and sharpness of an image and most often used as a metric to judge the quality of cameras, monitors, printers, etc.</p><p> It basically refers to the number of different pixels in each dimension which can be viewed in any display device.</p><p><strong>File Size</strong></p><p> File size refers to the space that a file occupies in a storage medium, like hard drive or USB. The measure of file sizes can be expressed in bytes (B), kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), terabytes (TB), and so on.</p><p> As shown in the picture below, the files listed in the <a class="link"   href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/e/explorer.htm" >Windows Explorer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> assorted as per the file with the largest size first. The file with the name “family-safety.jpg” occupies the largest size of 47 KB and the smallest one with 32 KB size.</p><p><strong>Codec</strong></p><p> Codec is a device or maybe a computer program that is used to encode or decode a stream of digital data or signal. A codec is a short form of “coder-decoder”.</p><p> The basic function of a coder is to encode the stream of data or signal for storage or transmission, usually in an encrypted form.</p><p> While, a decoder decodes the encoded (possibly encrypted) data, which is merely a reverse process of a coder. The application of codec are in streaming media, videoconferencing, and video editing applications.</p><p><strong>Aspect ratio:</strong></p><p> This term refers to the proportion of your video. In other words, the video aspect ratio can be defined as the width or breadth (of an image or screen) with respect to its height. Such a ratio can be expressed or represented in the form of “width x height.</p><p> That means an aspect ratio of 4x3 refers to an image that is 4 units wide and 3 units high. Similarly, it can also be expressed with a colon in between the units such as 4:3 or 16:9.</p><p><strong>Need a YouTube support?</strong></p><p> If you need any support, guidance or may face any queries related to anything regarding your YouTube channel, here’s the link of <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/?hl=en#topic=9257498" >YouTube support <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075471/7443" target="_top" id="2075471"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075471"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075471/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p> Hopefully, with this detailed guide, you are now ready to make a wise decision regarding customizing your videos and channel as per viewers likeliness.

The idea is simple: shoot a video with a single colored backdrop (blue or green is often used), and then replace the background with any other video clip, graphic or still image you want. It’s highly effective and can be used for different topics and subjects. If you don’t know what a green screen is and how it works, check out the video tutorial below to get an overall idea first:</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p>In fact, nowadays, green screen is actually well within the capabilities and budget of people like you and I. Just shoot your video anywhere, and then replace the background with any stock photo, branded graphic or fantastic video clips. Want to try it out? You’d better get your own green screen ideas first. Now let’s watch some Youtube green screen videos and get inspired.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Shoot a Green Screen Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>You can also get some cool video effects from Wondershare Filmora Effects Store.

The “Share” function in the playlist does not work because it is set to “private,” and YouTube doesn’t allow you to share them. To fix this, you must first change the privacy settings of the playlist to “public” in the following way:</p><p>Step1 Head to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website using a browser on your PC and sign in to your account.</p><p>Step2</p><ul><li><strong>Click</strong> the three-line <strong>“Menu”</strong> icon at the top-left of your screen.</li><li>Go to <strong>“Library.”</strong></li><li>Scroll down to the <strong>“Playlist”</strong> section.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/changing-playlist-visibility.png"                      alt="changing playlist visibility"                ></p><p>Step3 Select your playlist labeled as <strong>“Private.”</strong> On the next page, click the <strong>“Private”</strong> option in the playlist details section and select <strong>“Public”</strong> to change the visibility of your playlist.</p><p>Once the privacy setting has been changed, the <strong>“share”</strong> function will work as intended.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/making-youtube-playlist-public.png"                      alt="making youtube playlist public"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist"><a href="#How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist" class="headerlink" title="How To Share The YouTube Playlist?"></a>How To Share The YouTube Playlist?</h2><p>If you want to share the playlist on YouTube using your computer or mobile device, read the instructions below carefully:</p><h3 id="1-For-Computers"><a href="#1-For-Computers" class="headerlink" title="1.

These vlogs are all about aesthetics, so it is important that the videos themselves are beautiful. When you are giving out tips on makeup or hair you want to use a setup that will make your results look their very best.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Beauty-Vlogger-Set-Up"><a href="#YouTube-Beauty-Vlogger-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Beauty Vlogger Set Up"></a>YouTube Beauty Vlogger Set Up</h2><p>It’s easy to put together your own Beauty Vlog setup. There are four main elements; lighting, beauty supplies, backgrounds, and audio. Here are some tips on building your beauty guru set:</p><h4 id="1-Light-It-Up"><a href="#1-Light-It-Up" class="headerlink" title="1. Light It Up"></a>1. Light It Up</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/beauty-vlog01.JPG"                      alt="beauty vlog01"                ></p><p>Beauty Vlogs need to have great lighting so that everyone can clearly see what you are doing and how amazing it looks. Make sure you have even light over your whole face by ‘front lighting’ your vlog. Front lighting means having a light source right in front of you.</p><p>Depending on your budget, you can either use a window as a front light or buy a diva ring light.</p><p><strong>Using a Window:</strong>  Face the window while you vlog and be careful that the camera’s shadow is not visible in your shot. Avoid using a window the sun is shining directly into. You want softer, more diffused, light for a beauty vlog.</p><p><strong>Using a Ring Light:</strong>  Mount your camera either inside the ring or right behind it on a tripod. Ring lights are powerful options for illuminating your entire face, and they are very popular with makeup vloggers.</p><p>Front lighting can make you appear flat against your background, so it is also a good idea to set up a backlight behind you to make you pop out. Setting up lights on either side of you can also help add dimension to your shot.</p><p>Check this tutorial to know more details:</p><h4 id="2-Organize-Your-Makeup"><a href="#2-Organize-Your-Makeup" class="headerlink" title="2. Organize Your Makeup"></a>2. Organize Your Makeup</h4><p>Having to search for makeup or reach across to where you are storing your curling iron will kill your vlogging momentum. Creating a great look is the fun part of beauty vlogging, and probably the part you want to focus on. Not looking for your missing brush. The best way to set yourself up for a beauty vlog is at a desk or table where you can lay everything out neatly right in front of you.</p><h4 id="3-Alter-Your-Background"><a href="#3-Alter-Your-Background" class="headerlink" title="3. Alter Your Background"></a>3. Alter Your Background</h4><p>Making your vlog look more professional can be as easy as dressing up your background. You do not want there to be a lot of clutter behind you, but you don’t want to shoot with your back to a plain beige wall either. One simple way to keep your background beautiful, but not distracting, is to use a backdrop. Just hang a sheet or other piece of fabric behind you. You can even use patterns and change your backdrop to match your makeup in different videos.</p><p>Another great way to disguise the room you are vlogging in, and make sure nothing behind you distracts your viewers, is to blur your background. You really stand out when your background is blurry and you are in perfect focus.</p><h4 id="4-Be-Audible"><a href="#4-Be-Audible" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Audible"></a>4. Be Audible</h4><p>You have a lot to say, so make sure people can hear you. Most cameras do not have great microphones, so you will need to use an external mic. To see what kinds of options you have make sure to read and watch “<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Microphone for YouTube - Top 5 Mics for YouTube Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>”.</p><p>If you do not have access to an external mic then you may be able to get by without one for a while using software. Make sure there is no background noise competing with your voice, and download a free audio editing program called Audacity from Audacityteam.org. Using Audacity you will be able to improve a mediocre audio recording from your camera and make it usable. This is a popular option among YouTube gamers who record both video and audio from their webcams, but there is no reason it should not be useful for beauty gurus too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tinyland.pxf.io/c/5597632/1793214/19135" target="_top" id="1793214"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793214"                      border="0" alt="" width="900" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793214/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Charting-Your-Way-to-Frequent-Payments-From-YouTube"><a href="#Charting-Your-Way-to-Frequent-Payments-From-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Charting Your Way to Frequent Payments From YouTube"></a>Charting Your Way to Frequent Payments From YouTube</h2><p>Any YouTuber can earn passive income monthly if they’ve reached the YouTube Partner Programme (YPP) requirement? Yes, the YouTube Partner Program gives creators access to start generating revenue with their channel once they reach a minimum of 1,000 YouTube subscribers and 4,000 watch ours in the last twelve months.</p><p>For anyone looking to start earning passive income via YouTube, but have the question, <strong>“Does YouTube pay monthly?” The answer is YES YouTube pays monthly</strong>. However, there are other things you must know if you want to start making money from YouTube. So, in this article, we will discuss all you need to know about how often YouTube pays and other YouTube monetization tips.</p><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">Affiliate Marketing</a></li><li><a href="#part3-2">Brand Sponsorship</a></li><li><a href="#part3-3">Selling Own Products or Services</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">More FAQs About How Much YouTubers Make</a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/427477/5172" target="_top" id="427477"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-427477"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/427477/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-How-Often-Does-YouTube-Pay"><a href="#Part-1-How-Often-Does-YouTube-Pay" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How Often Does YouTube Pay"></a>Part 1: How Often Does YouTube Pay</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, YouTube pays monthly. It’s usually within the first 10-14 days of a new month (10th day or 14th day of a new month). However, to be able to receive your funds, you must reach the minimum threshold of your local currency as required by YouTube. For example, $100 for content creators within the United States.</p><p>Also, you must comply with the YouTube monetization policies and not be suspended by YouTube in the past month.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-YouTube-Pay-–-Typical-Methods-Used"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-YouTube-Pay-–-Typical-Methods-Used" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does YouTube Pay – Typical Methods Used"></a>Part 2: How Does YouTube Pay – Typical Methods Used</h2><p>Research shows that YouTube’s average pay rate is within the range of $0.01 to $0.03 per ad view. This means for every 1,000 ad views, a YouTuber could earn $18, while for every 1,000 video views, you could earn $3 to $5.

Bokeh is when you blur lights in the background of your shot, creating halo-like circles of light. By attaching a filter with a shape cut out to the camera lens, you can even generate bokeh lights in other shapes, like hearts or stars.</p><p> <strong>Aperture</strong> refers to the hole in your lens which allows light into your camera. A narrow aperture lets in less light, and a wide aperture lets in more. The wider your aperture is, the shallower your depth of field will be. Widening your aperture also helps your camera perform better in low-light situations. Widening your aperture too much under the wrong circumstances can let in too much light and result in your footage being overexposed.</p><p> <strong>Depth of Field</strong> is the area of your image that is in focus. If you have a large depth of field, then objects close to and far away from your camera will all be in focus. Only a select area will be focused and the rest will be blurred if you have a shallow depth of field.</p><p> <strong>F-Stops</strong> are the measurement of an aperture’s width. The higher your f-stop, the narrower your aperture will be. To create a blurred background or a bokeh effect, you need a wide aperture, and thus a small f-stop. F-stops are written like ‘f&#x2F;1.4’. You need an f-stop of less than f&#x2F;4 to blur your background, and less than f&#x2F;2.8 for bokeh.</p><h4 id="1-Blurring-and-Bokeh"><a href="#1-Blurring-and-Bokeh" class="headerlink" title="1. Blurring and Bokeh"></a>1. Blurring and Bokeh</h4><p>Blurred backgrounds and bokeh are very closely related. A bokeh effect is essentially a blurred background that includes lights.<br>To achieve a blurred background or a bokeh effect, you need to have a shallow depth of field. That means a wide aperture and a low f-stop.</p><h4 id="2-How-to-Blur-your-Background"><a href="#2-How-to-Blur-your-Background" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Blur your Background"></a>2. How to Blur your Background</h4><p>Place your subject – in the case of a vlog, your subject is probably yourself – in a shallow depth of field, and they will remain sharply in focus while everything behind them is blurred.</p><p>If the subject is yourself, you might need a helper to either operate your camera or stand in for you while you set up your camera. You will need to be able to check that the place you plan to stand or sit is in focus.</p><p>To get a shallow depth of field, make sure your aperture is wide. Do this by setting a low f-stop. Ideally, your f-stop will be 2.8 or lower, but if your camera cannot go that low, then f&#x2F;3 or f&#x2F;4 can also work.</p><p>Creating a bokeh effect is mostly the same, except that it works best when your subject&#x2F;depth of field is very close to the camera, and you have a light source off in the background. Zoom Lenses do not usually have wide enough apertures to create bokeh backgrounds.</p><h2 id="Blur-Video-Background-in-Post-Production-with-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#Blur-Video-Background-in-Post-Production-with-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Blur Video Background in Post-Production with Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>Blur Video Background in Post-Production with Wondershare Filmora Video Editor</h2><p>If you need to blur the video background after shooting, you can use some video editing software to add the bokeh effect or the tilt-off effect in post-production. Here, I will show you how to do that in Filmora.</p><p>Filmora is one of the most widely used video editing software among YouTubers. Its user-friendly interface and tutorial guide enables green-hands to start video editing quickly. Besides, you can find many free filters, effects, and elements pre-programmed, so you can use them directly without looking for presets and templates somewhere else.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1872456/14483" target="_top" id="1872456"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1872456"                      border="0" alt="" width="500" height="375"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1872456/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Add-Bokeh-Filter-to-Video-in-Filmora"><a href="#1-Add-Bokeh-Filter-to-Video-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1.

The only way to avoid being absolutely sure that your reaction video isn’t violating the law is to contact the video creator and ask for permission to use their intellectual property. However, most YouTubers are reluctant to let others download and edit their videos unless they already have a large fan base.</p><p>In case you’re granted permission to comment on a video, you have nothing to worry about. However, if you don’t get the permission you’re all the money the reaction video generates will go to the copyright owner or you will be forced to delete the video from your channel. There are still a few things you can do, even if you don’t get permission to use the video you would like to comment on.</p><p>Muting the video’s audio or altering its pitch will make it more difficult for YouTube’s bots to detect copyright infringement, although this method may not always work. In addition, you can play a video for up to thirty seconds, then comment on that segment, and then play another segment of that video.</p><p>There is no way of saying whether any of these editing tricks are going to help you avoid a copyright claim, and you should only use them if you have no other option.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Anyone can master the technical aspects of making a reaction video, but the topics you react to need to be related to the general topic your channel covers. What’s more, the idea of your reaction video has to be relevant for your audience if you want to attract their attention.

Therefore, users enjoy a significant deal of variety when choosing which ones to view. YouTubers may yield a more favorable ranking by creating a catchy title.</p><p>On-page YouTube ranking optimization is crucial if you want to get a higher video ranking. Metadata is one of the YouTube ranking factors; this includes your video title. Essentially, titles give the first impression of any video to end users, YouTube, and search engines.</p><p>A well-titled video attracts more traffic, which translates to more views.

Keep in mind that thumbnails with a 16:9 aspect ratio and a 1280-by-20-pixel resolution generally perform best.</p><h4 id="Number-of-Views-3"><a href="#Number-of-Views-3" class="headerlink" title="Number of Views"></a>Number of Views</h4><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1572622/13846" target="_top" id="1572622"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1572622"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1298"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1572622/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-6.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Number of Views"                ></p><p>Views are a vital YouTube ranking factor, as people are more likely to watch videos with a high number of views. The more views your video has, the higher it will rank, especially for competitive keywords.</p><p>If you want to rank high for competitive keywords, ensure that your videos get loads of views. For this reason, you have to take steps and get your video content on other platforms. In turn, you will increase the visibility of your videos and view count.</p><p>You could embed your videos into your blog posts or share them on social media platforms to get more people to watch them.</p><h4 id="Closed-Captions-and-Subtitles-3"><a href="#Closed-Captions-and-Subtitles-3" class="headerlink" title="Closed Captions and Subtitles"></a>Closed Captions and Subtitles</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-7.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Closed Captions and Subtitles"                ></p><p>Adding captions to videos with spoken-word content can improve your YouTube video ranking. Essentially, it opens up your videos to a larger audience, including people who are deaf and anyone speaking a different language from the one in your videos. Search engines also crawl close captions, which can boost your rankings.</p><p>While YouTube offers automatic captioning, it is not perfect. So you may need to make some edits or upload the captions yourself.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/336__280a.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Optimize-Your-YouTube-Ranking-3"><a href="#How-to-Optimize-Your-YouTube-Ranking-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Optimize Your YouTube Ranking"></a>How to Optimize Your YouTube Ranking</h2><h4 id="Focusing-on-User-Engagement-3"><a href="#Focusing-on-User-Engagement-3" class="headerlink" title="Focusing on User Engagement"></a>Focusing on User Engagement</h4><p>One of the best YouTube ranking optimization practices that you can implement is asking users to leave comments, like your videos, and share them. YouTube analyzes these metrics to determine the quality of your content.

Use related hashtags when creating your descriptions to ensure people find your videos when searching for specific hashtags.</p><p>Tags help drive search because they make main trends more visible. After adding a hashtag to the description, it will appear above the video title, and viewers will see it hyperlinked.</p><h4 id="Categorizing-Your-Video-3"><a href="#Categorizing-Your-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Categorizing Your Video"></a>Categorizing Your Video</h4><p>After uploading your video, you should categorize it by going to Advanced settings.

In turn, this will help your videos to rank higher.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/517826/4704" target="_top" id="517826"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-517826"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/517826/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>With 720,000 hours of video being uploaded every day to YouTube, getting your videos to rank high is challenging.

Get the best pictures with the Sony DSC WX350. This camera offers both still photos and video recording, using technology that minimizes how much the camera shakes, even if you’re filming on the go.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> The image stabilizer makes this one of the best cameras for making YouTube videos out there, alongside of the 20x optical zoom. The battery life is quite long as well, which means you can get a lot of content done without any problems. Lastly, you can film in HD, which makes any YouTube influencer happy.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> The LED screen can be quite dim, so it’s hard to see it when you’re out in bright sunlight; be sure you make adjustments before you go outside. There is also not your typical viewfinder installed, so experienced videographers may not like using it.</p><h3 id="2-GoPro-HERO8-Action-Camera"><a href="#2-GoPro-HERO8-Action-Camera" class="headerlink" title="2.

The integrated mount makes it simple for anyone who wants to put it on a selfie stick or something else, and it even has a companion app for easy, on the go editing!</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> The Wi-Fi capabilities are great, but the video transfer can take a bit of time due to how large the files may be. So, if you’re uploading the transfer, you may want to consider using the USB port instead. Also, the memory card slot is in an awkward place near the mount, so those with larger fingers may have trouble putting a card in there.</p><h3 id="3-Logitech-BRIO-HD-Webcam-for-Video"><a href="#3-Logitech-BRIO-HD-Webcam-for-Video" class="headerlink" title="3.

With multiple features and a design that has been made for streamers like you, you’ll always be able to just turn it on, make adjustments with ease, and get streaming in no time.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> The camera is incredibly easy to use and install; it connects to your PC with a USB type C to USB type 3.0 cord (backwards compatible to 2.0). You can easily tinker with all of the settings and such in the included software.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> The arm is designed for thick edges; those with flat monitors or borderless monitors may find that it’s difficult to attach it to your monitor. The software is easy to use, but it’s missing a handful of settings that more experienced streamers would want to have available. There is a crop out background feature, but it can be hard to find and use.</p><h3 id="4-PANASONIC-Lumix-G7-4K-Digital-Camera"><a href="#4-PANASONIC-Lumix-G7-4K-Digital-Camera" class="headerlink" title="4.

All of the controls make it easy to get things the way that you want it, and it comes with multiple ports so that you can plug it into any device and get it ready to go.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> This one of the best 4k video options out there, and you don’t need to spend an arm and a leg on it. The dual control dials and the variable touch LCD allow for maximum control, making it simple to film what you want with minimal editing after you’ve filmed.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> There is a tracking focus, which can be good, but it makes the burst rate (which helps with motion blur) a lot slower. It does have a plastic build, rather than metal, so it’s not as heavy duty as other options. And, you need to purchase it with everything included, instead of just purchasing the body.</p><h3 id="5-Sony-CX405-Full-HD"><a href="#5-Sony-CX405-Full-HD" class="headerlink" title="5.

It’s the starter camera that beginners dream of due to its ease of use and affordability.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> The image stabilization is some of the best out there, and it’s got a user friendly interface. Dual recording options make for great YouTube and other social media use. Lightweight makes it easy to take anywhere.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Connectivity ports are in strange spots, and can be hard to get to. You cannot add an external mic, so you have to use the on-board ones. After extensive use of the ports, the on-board USB cable may have some issues with connectivity over time.</p><h3 id="6-DJI-OSMO-Handheld-Gimbal"><a href="#6-DJI-OSMO-Handheld-Gimbal" class="headerlink" title="6.

Another complaint is that it can be difficult to get used the construction of the Gimbal, but that’s something that you can sort out with practice.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/427477/5172" target="_top" id="427477"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-427477"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/427477/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Canon-Digital-SLR-Camera-Kit"><a href="#7-Canon-Digital-SLR-Camera-Kit" class="headerlink" title="7.

All of the music on this site is free.</p><p>One of the first things you’ll see when you arrive on Audiionautix is a ‘YouTube Friendly’ button. They know that most people browsing their music library are looking for songs for YouTube videos, and that want you to know their music is safe from copyright claims.</p><p>All of the music in the Audionautix collection was created by one man, Jason Shaw, but there’s still a huge variety of tracks.</p><p>On the front page of Audionautix, there are three selections you can make to start your music search – genre, mood, and tempo. Genres range from hard rock to bluegrass to techno (there are 28 genres in total), and the moods include things like ‘uplifting’, ‘evil’, and ‘bouncy’ (there are 37 of those). The tempos are fast, medium, and slow. So, if you want a medium-tempo acoustic song with a calming mood, you can easily find all of the songs that meet those qualifications.</p><p>Not every combination will deliver results, so it can be easier to just choose two of the three search parameters.</p><h4 id="2-Bensound"><a href="#2-Bensound" class="headerlink" title="2.

Beyond the titles of the tracks, each has a short description that will give you a good idea of what to expect from the song before you listen. You’ll need to listen to a song to know if you want it, but the descriptions are a fast way to figure out if you don’t want something. For example, ‘A New Beginning’ could be anything based on that title, but the description lets you know it’s ‘punk rock’ with an ‘epic&#x2F;achievement’ feeling.</p><p>You can narrow down the music you are shown by choosing a genre from the menu near the top of your page (there are 8 genres including cinematic, electronica, and corporate&#x2F;pop). There’s also a search bar, and you can choose whether to display popular or new songs first.</p><p>All of the music on Bensound was created by Benjamin TISSOT, a composer based in France.

You can also specify if you only want instrumental songs.</p><p>If you do not use the ‘free for commercial use’ filter then you will need to click on songs to see whether their creative commons licenses allow commercial use.</p><p>If you’re an indie game developer, they have a Music for Video Games section for you too.</p><h4 id="4-Free-Music-Archive"><a href="#4-Free-Music-Archive" class="headerlink" title="4.

For your information, AV1 is a video codec that is developed by a consortium of companies. It offers you advanced compression, enabling you to do smoother HD streaming and data savings for the video. Google also has already implemented AV1 use on YouTube. To turn on AV1 settings on YouTube, here are the steps:</p><h5 id="Step1Go-to-playback-and-performance"><a href="#Step1Go-to-playback-and-performance" class="headerlink" title="Step1Go to playback and performance"></a>Step1Go to playback and performance</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-2.jpg"                      alt="youtube settings"                ></p><ul><li>To turn on the AV1 settings, go to your YouTube account, after that click “Playback and Performance”.</li><li>In the AV1 settings.

As you know, there is also another video codec like VP9. There are also the others such as VVC, and many more. So what is the superiority of AV1 over the others? I will let you know why you should choose AV1 in this part.</p><p>The main thing is, as mentioned before, AV1 is developed by a consortium of companies founded in 2015. It is supported by The Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia) such as Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix, and also by web browser developers and semiconductor firms. Aomedia made it clear the algorithm is free-to-use. It means that there are no greedy negotiators that will be dependent on the developers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://proteahair.pxf.io/c/5597632/1983634/23621" target="_top" id="1983634"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1983634"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983634/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-4.jpg"                      alt="giant techs behind av1"                ></p><p>Also, these days, with a format that provides a much smaller workload for internet providers. Their today focus is, that AV1 can reach the quality but can get the job done with 20% more efficiency. Then, with AV1 encoding, a “standard” 4K movie will be much more accessible than it is now.

It means that it is not just free to use, but also free of charge, obligations, or even liability. It is an open and royalty-free video codec that the video platform will not charge to pay royalties to the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), the developer of video codecs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-5.jpg"                      alt="av1 is royalty-free"                ></p><p>When it comes to the group that will ask for the royalty, MPEG is not the only one.

According to the tests conducted by Moscow State University, AV1 can outperform AV1 by about 28% in the efficiency of encoding and decoding. As per the performance graph from the Graphics &amp; Media Lab Video Group, MSU below, AV1 can offer the exactly same quality as X264 at 55% of the average bitrate.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-6.jpg"                      alt="av1 benefit"                ></p><p>AV1 is designed so exclusively to function better than all the other codecs in the market. It is an open-sourced codec with simple patent licensing, and the integration manages to save, as mentioned, up to 30% of the bandwidth for the exactly same image quality. In other words, with AV1, distributors can send streams much faster and cheaper and we can enjoy higher definitions in the same bandwidth.</p><h3 id="3-AV2-to-come-in-the-future"><a href="#3-AV2-to-come-in-the-future" class="headerlink" title="3.

AV2 to come in the future</h3><p>AV1 is undoubtedly superior if we compare it to other available video codecs and the exploration of the codec technology AV2 has already begun. This is such an early performance evaluation. There is some interesting part of the exploration development of AV2, such as multiple line selection for Intra prediction can make you select not just neighboring row&#x2F;column for directional prediction. The same tool also exists in VVC.</p><p>There are also three essential improvements, which are simplifying the existing feature (also complete removal) and picking the tool used by VVC&#x2F;H.266 (It is lack originality but so much work on it) and improvement periodically improvement of an existing tool, it is too few and also not original.

The idea is simple: shoot a video with a single colored backdrop (blue or green is often used), and then replace the background with any other video clip, graphic or still image you want. It’s highly effective and can be used for different topics and subjects. If you don’t know what a green screen is and how it works, check out the video tutorial below to get an overall idea first:</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p>In fact, nowadays, green screen is actually well within the capabilities and budget of people like you and I. Just shoot your video anywhere, and then replace the background with any stock photo, branded graphic or fantastic video clips. Want to try it out? You’d better get your own green screen ideas first.

YouTube ads when compared to PPC are relatively cheaper and you also choose how much you are willing to pay when a user clicks on the ads. This makes it unlikely that you could spend more than you intended to.</p><p>YouTube ads are also more targeted than any other form of advertising. You have a lot of options when choosing who you want to target including metrics such as demographics, topics, similar audiences, customer matches, life events, and more.</p><p>Since the ad is a video, it generates far more engagement than a text ad on any other platform. Even though it is an ad, the video is still a great way for your brand to connect with potential audiences.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068411/7443" target="_top" id="2068411"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068411"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Types-of-Video-Ads-for-YouTube"><a href="#Types-of-Video-Ads-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Types of Video Ads for YouTube"></a>Types of Video Ads for YouTube</h2><p>The following are the different types of YouTube ads that you can create;</p><p>**<strong>Video Discovery</strong></p><p>Video discover ads appear on the search page results and are usually composed of a thumbnail image and a few lines of text. They also have a very recognizable “Ad” in the box to let all users know that this is sponsored content.</p><p>**<strong>In-Stream Ads</strong></p><p>In-stream video ads can be skippable or non-skippable. Skippable in-stream video ads will often play for a minimum of 5 seconds before allowing the user to skip to the video content. Non-skippable in-stream video ads do not have the “skip” button and the user has to watch the video to the end.</p><p>**<strong>Pre-roll Ads</strong></p><p>A pre-roll ad is just an in-stream ad that is not skippable. It doesn’t give the user the option of skipping the app and they have to watch the entire ad before they can watch the video. The pre-roll video ad is usually 15 to 60 seconds long.</p><p>**<strong>Bumper Ads</strong></p><p>Bumper ads are tiny non-skippable 6-second ads that will play right before the video content loads. They can be an ideal way to promote an event or a new brand. Since they are only 6 seconds long, they can be very easy to make.</p><h2 id="Best-YouTube-Ad-Creators"><a href="#Best-YouTube-Ad-Creators" class="headerlink" title="Best YouTube Ad Creators"></a>Best YouTube Ad Creators</h2><p>The following are the best YouTube ad creators that you can use to make your YouTube video ad;</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033095&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Advanced-3YR.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Filmora"><a href="#Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Filmora"></a>Filmora</h3><p>Best For: All Types of YouTube Video ads</p><p>Price: Free Trial Available with plans starting from $54.99 a year.</p><p>Rating: 4.8&#x2F;5</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/adjust-border-pip-video.jpg"                      alt="filmora ad video maker"                ></p><p>Wondershare Filmora is one of the best video creation software in the market and therefore can be very useful when creating YouTube video ads of any kind.

This size balances quality and file size, ensuring that your thumbnail looks sharp and loads quickly. It’s also important to note that YouTube thumbnails are displayed at different sizes depending on the device and context in which they are viewed.</p><p>For example, a thumbnail may be displayed at a larger size when it’s shown as the main thumbnail for a video but smaller when it’s shown in a list of related videos.</p><h3 id="Q3-What-Thumbnail-Gets-the-Most-Clicks-1"><a href="#Q3-What-Thumbnail-Gets-the-Most-Clicks-1" class="headerlink" title="Q3.

Although being a faceless artist allows you to have a little more privacy on the internet, some viewers like to see a person on-screen.</p><p>So, what’s the best way to win over both sides? However, becoming a virtual YouTuber allows you to have your cake and eat it, as well. Vtubing is similar to live streaming, only that instead of showing your face, your facial emotions and movements are recorded by a digital avatar. Vtubing has grown considerably more accessible, with a large number of people watching Vtubing videos on YouTube.</p><p>Moreover, Every VTuber is essentially a character. Whether they’re just being themselves on camera or acting out a backstory they made up, watching a VTuber is like watching an anime in and of itself. The avatars or characters provide VTubers with a lot of creative freedom, allowing them to create unique material.</p><p>Being a VTuber isn’t all that different from being a regular one in terms of technicalities. However, it would be beneficial if you still had a good notion of what you want to do with your channel.

This avatar is created using computer graphics (CG), and it frequently has an anime-inspired look.

While she wasn’t the first to employ a CG avatar for video blogging, she is almost entirely to blame for the VTubers craze exploding in Japan and then the rest of the world in late 2016. Because Kizuna AI grew in popularity so quickly, new VTubers began to appear regularly. Some creators, who had already established their platform and&#x2F;or displayed their faces on camera, created VTuber versions of themselves simply to jump on the bandwagon.</p><p>According to User Local, a Japanese data technology firm, over 10,000 active VTubers will exist on YouTube alone by 2020. Kizuna AI, who has the highest following of all VTubers on the internet at the time of writing, has over 10 million subscribers across all of her social media sites (YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, and Bilibili).</p><h4 id="Is-VTubers-the-Next-Big-Thing-in-Video-Content"><a href="#Is-VTubers-the-Next-Big-Thing-in-Video-Content" class="headerlink" title="Is VTubers the Next Big Thing in Video Content?"></a>Is VTubers the Next Big Thing in Video Content?</h4><p>If you follow video marketing trends, you may have seen an uptick in animated videos featuring anime-style avatars. VTubers are the creators of this content, and it’s taking the world by storm. Top VTubers earn hundreds of thousands of dollars every month and have millions of followers. The industry, according to analysts, is on the increase.</p><p>In 2019, the overall number of VTuber subscribers climbed by 28%, while total views of Vtuber content increased by 99 percent, according to HyperSense. This may not appear to be a severe trend at first sight. Virtual YouTubers, on the other hand, are being used by marketers and corporations like Mattel and KFC to promote genuine engagement.</p><h4 id="Top-5-Virtual-YouTubers"><a href="#Top-5-Virtual-YouTubers" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 Virtual YouTubers"></a>Top 5 Virtual YouTubers</h4><p>The following are the top 5 virtual YouTubers. Each of their videos can be watched for a few minutes with English subtitles.</p><h5 id="1-Kizuna-AI"><a href="#1-Kizuna-AI" class="headerlink" title="1. Kizuna AI"></a>1. Kizuna AI</h5><p>Kizuna AI is one of Japan’s most well-known and popular female vloggers, with over two million subscribers to her channel. She appears to be a pop star, but she is artificial intelligence, as she boasts. Since she began posting videos on her main channel, A.I.Channel, in 2016, she has gained a considerable following. On the channel, she discusses various topics and plays popular games. A.I.Games, a Kizuna AI YouTube channel dedicated to games, A.I.Games is also available. She is enthusiastic and honest in both good and bad ways, which is one of her best qualities.</p><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4YaOt1yT-ZeyB0OmxHgolA" >https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4YaOt1yT-ZeyB0OmxHgolA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h5 id="2-Kaguya-Luna"><a href="#2-Kaguya-Luna" class="headerlink" title="2. Kaguya Luna"></a>2. Kaguya Luna</h5><p>Kaguya Luna is a popular Japanese vlogger who launched her Kaguya Luna Official channel in 2017. She is one of the Big Four VTubers, with over a million subscribers. Kaguya Luna is adored because she presents herself in such a way. Her videos are mostly made up of her free-wheeling speaking without any acting scripts. Her high-pitched voice is striking, and she is always active and talkative. She also performs as a pop vocalist in a live presentation.v</p><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQYADFw7xEJ9oZSM5ZbqyBw" >https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQYADFw7xEJ9oZSM5ZbqyBw <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h5 id="3-Hoshimachi-Suisei"><a href="#3-Hoshimachi-Suisei" class="headerlink" title="3. Hoshimachi Suisei"></a>3. Hoshimachi Suisei</h5><p>Suisei is an idol singer who debuted independently in 2018 before joining the Hololive group. She aims to perform onstage at the Tokyo Budokan. Her deep alto voice is ideal for covers such as Zombieland Saga’s “Saga Jihen,” as well as her original compositions such as “Next Color Planet” and “Ghost.” She also has a reputation as a sociopath, which was established after she violently backstabbed her fellow Hololive stars in a Project Winter playthrough.</p><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5CwaMl1eIgY8h02uZw7u8A" >https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5CwaMl1eIgY8h02uZw7u8A <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h5 id="4-Usada-Pekora"><a href="#4-Usada-Pekora" class="headerlink" title="4. Usada Pekora"></a>4. Usada Pekora</h5><p>This adorable little kitten is the most popular VTuber from VShojo’s English-language agency, and it’s easy to understand why her “Nyanderthals” like her. Nyatasha is best known for covering rap songs and going off on obscene tangents with lines like “It’s not about wiping my ass, it’s about sending a message,” despite how innocent she appears and sounds.</p><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1DCedRgGHBdm81E1llLhOQ" >https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1DCedRgGHBdm81E1llLhOQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h5 id="5-Sakura-Miko"><a href="#5-Sakura-Miko" class="headerlink" title="5. Sakura Miko"></a>5. Sakura Miko</h5><p>Nyahello! Sakura, a shrine maiden with a theatrical demeanour and a dubious aptitude for video games, began her career as a freelance VTuber before joining Hololive. Her bombastic attitude is part of her appeal: she gets overly passionate about unimportant games, uses any excuse to stare up a female character’s skirt, and swears profusely in Japanese and English whenever she is frustrated. It’s never boring to see her shenanigans.</p><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-hM6YJuNYVAmUWxeIr9FeA" >https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-hM6YJuNYVAmUWxeIr9FeA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="What-Does-It-Take-to-Become-a-Virtual-YouTuber"><a href="#What-Does-It-Take-to-Become-a-Virtual-YouTuber" class="headerlink" title="What Does It Take to Become a Virtual YouTuber?"></a>What Does It Take to Become a Virtual YouTuber?</h2><p>If you’ve been watching YouTube for a while, you’ve most likely noticed the VTuber trend, which began in 2017. Instead of displaying their faces, VTubers, or Virtual YouTubers, communicate with their viewers using an avatar. As this trend grows in popularity (and VTubers gain more subscribers), a lot of people are curious about how they do it. Here are answers to all of your questions on how to become a VTuber on YouTube so you may live out your virtual fantasies.</p><p>A high-end PC with enough storage space and a powerful graphics card is required for VTubers. A webcam that tracks motion and connects to your computer is required. The most prominent VTubers employ a blue screen and green room arrangement, which simply consists of walls with one color painted on them in the background of their vlogs so that everything looks to be happening inside an empty virtual area while they walk around.</p><p>Investing a lot of money in supplies or equipment for your virtual YouTuber setup isn’t essential, just like it isn’t required for any other creative endeavor. Buying such items may yield greater results if you know how to utilize them effectively but becoming a VTuber may be done for very little money, if at all.</p><h2 id="How-to-become-a-virtual-youtuber"><a href="#How-to-become-a-virtual-youtuber" class="headerlink" title="How to become a virtual youtuber?"></a>How to become a virtual youtuber?</h2><h4 id="1-Selecting-a-Model"><a href="#1-Selecting-a-Model" class="headerlink" title="1. Selecting a Model"></a>1. Selecting a Model</h4><p>To become a virtual YouTuber, you’ll need a model to play the role of your online persona. There are several other ways to do this, but Live2D is the most popular among elite VTubers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/virtual-youtuber-1.png"                      alt="how to become a virtual youtuber"                ></p><h4 id="2-Make-your-model-move"><a href="#2-Make-your-model-move" class="headerlink" title="2. Make your model move"></a>2. Make your model move</h4><p>A model must be set up before it can move. In computer graphics, rigging is the process of generating and connecting a rig or bone structure to a model, which can subsequently be animated. When working in two dimensions, this usually entails dividing an image into the pieces you want to move.</p><p>You’ll want to set up a webcam to track your movements once you’ve created a rigged model. As a result, your model will adjust to fit you every time you move. Most VTubers only track their faces, but hand movements are becoming increasingly popular.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://vapordna.pxf.io/c/5597632/1496243/17238" target="_top" id="1496243"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17238-1496243"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1221"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1496243/17238"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/virtual-youtuber-2.png"                      alt="become a virtual youtuber"                ></p><h4 id="3-Streaming-and-or-Recording"><a href="#3-Streaming-and-or-Recording" class="headerlink" title="3. Streaming and&#x2F;or Recording"></a>3. Streaming and&#x2F;or Recording</h4><p>This portion of VTubing isn’t all that dissimilar from creating regular video material. You’ll need something to record footage of your model as it moves in lockstep with you. VirtualCast, a free VR communication tool that allows you to be “anyone you choose to be” in a virtual world, may be used for pre-recorded videos. It does, however, necessitate the usage of a virtual reality headset.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>● In 2020, the popularity of VTuber content surged. There’s no better time than now to become a virtual YouTuber if you’ve been thinking about it for a long. After all, the nicest part about VTubing is that it’s available to everyone with a smart device and a camera.</p><p>● As VTubers are always looking for authenticity, you can become a successful VTuber by sharing the things that matter. Keep an eye on VTubers with a large following and observe what they do. Seek feedback to help you improve your skills or ask for assistance if you require it. Create stuff that will pique the interest of others while also maintaining your own.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Faceless creators, or people who do not show their faces in their films, have become more prevalent on YouTube.

Selecting a Model"></a>1. Selecting a Model</h4><p>To become a virtual YouTuber, you’ll need a model to play the role of your online persona. There are several other ways to do this, but Live2D is the most popular among elite VTubers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/virtual-youtuber-1.png"                      alt="how to become a virtual youtuber"                ></p><h4 id="2-Make-your-model-move-1"><a href="#2-Make-your-model-move-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Make your model move"></a>2. Make your model move</h4><p>A model must be set up before it can move. In computer graphics, rigging is the process of generating and connecting a rig or bone structure to a model, which can subsequently be animated. When working in two dimensions, this usually entails dividing an image into the pieces you want to move.</p><p>You’ll want to set up a webcam to track your movements once you’ve created a rigged model. As a result, your model will adjust to fit you every time you move. Most VTubers only track their faces, but hand movements are becoming increasingly popular.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/virtual-youtuber-2.png"                      alt="become a virtual youtuber"                ></p><h4 id="3-Streaming-and-or-Recording-1"><a href="#3-Streaming-and-or-Recording-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

You’ll need something to record footage of your model as it moves in lockstep with you. VirtualCast, a free VR communication tool that allows you to be “anyone you choose to be” in a virtual world, may be used for pre-recorded videos. It does, however, necessitate the usage of a virtual reality headset.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993650">                    <video width="720" height="300" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993650">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:720px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993650%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993650/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Conclusion<p>● In 2020, the popularity of VTuber content surged. There’s no better time than now to become a virtual YouTuber if you’ve been thinking about it for a long. After all, the nicest part about VTubing is that it’s available to everyone with a smart device and a camera.</p><p>● As VTubers are always looking for authenticity, you can become a successful VTuber by sharing the things that matter. Keep an eye on VTubers with a large following and observe what they do. Seek feedback to help you improve your skills or ask for assistance if you require it. Create stuff that will pique the interest of others while also maintaining your own.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Faceless creators, or people who do not show their faces in their films, have become more prevalent on YouTube. Although being a faceless artist allows you to have a little more privacy on the internet, some viewers like to see a person on-screen.</p><p>So, what’s the best way to win over both sides? However, becoming a virtual YouTuber allows you to have your cake and eat it, as well. Vtubing is similar to live streaming, only that instead of showing your face, your facial emotions and movements are recorded by a digital avatar. Vtubing has grown considerably more accessible, with a large number of people watching Vtubing videos on YouTube.</p><p>Moreover, Every VTuber is essentially a character. Whether they’re just being themselves on camera or acting out a backstory they made up, watching a VTuber is like watching an anime in and of itself. The avatars or characters provide VTubers with a lot of creative freedom, allowing them to create unique material.</p><p>Being a VTuber isn’t all that different from being a regular one in terms of technicalities. However, it would be beneficial if you still had a good notion of what you want to do with your channel. Even though the two activities are conceptually equivalent, VTubing has a little greater entry barrier due to equipment needs.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-2"><a href="#In-this-article-2" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is a virtual YouTuber?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">What Does It Take to Become a Virtual YouTuber?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to become a virtual youtuber?</a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://newchic.sjv.io/c/5597632/1659704/14420" target="_top" id="1659704"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14420-1659704"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1659704/14420"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-a-virtual-YouTuber-2"><a href="#What-is-a-virtual-YouTuber-2" class="headerlink" title="What is a virtual YouTuber?"></a>What is a virtual YouTuber?</h2><p>A virtual YouTuber, or VTuber for short, is an online video maker or entertainment who represents themselves through a virtual avatar. This avatar is created using computer graphics (CG), and it frequently has an anime-inspired look. Most VTubers, as the name implies, utilize YouTube as their primary platform, while others do upload videos or host streams on other platforms (e.g., Twitch, Facebook Gaming, and so on) and are still referred to as such.</p><h2 id="Vtuber’s-Brief-History-2"><a href="#Vtuber’s-Brief-History-2" class="headerlink" title="Vtuber’s Brief History"></a>Vtuber’s Brief History</h2><p>Kizuna AI, a Japanese VTuber, created and popularized the phrase “virtual YouTuber” in 2016. While she wasn’t the first to employ a CG avatar for video blogging, she is almost entirely to blame for the VTubers craze exploding in Japan and then the rest of the world in late 2016. Because Kizuna AI grew in popularity so quickly, new VTubers began to appear regularly. Some creators, who had already established their platform and&#x2F;or displayed their faces on camera, created VTuber versions of themselves simply to jump on the bandwagon.</p><p>According to User Local, a Japanese data technology firm, over 10,000 active VTubers will exist on YouTube alone by 2020.

The industry, according to analysts, is on the increase.</p><p>In 2019, the overall number of VTuber subscribers climbed by 28%, while total views of Vtuber content increased by 99 percent, according to HyperSense.

Buying such items may yield greater results if you know how to utilize them effectively but becoming a VTuber may be done for very little money, if at all.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087407/7443" target="_top" id="2087407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087407"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="500"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-become-a-virtual-youtuber-2"><a href="#How-to-become-a-virtual-youtuber-2" class="headerlink" title="How to become a virtual youtuber?"></a>How to become a virtual youtuber?</h2><h4 id="1-Selecting-a-Model-2"><a href="#1-Selecting-a-Model-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

Although being a faceless artist allows you to have a little more privacy on the internet, some viewers like to see a person on-screen.</p><p>So, what’s the best way to win over both sides? However, becoming a virtual YouTuber allows you to have your cake and eat it, as well. Vtubing is similar to live streaming, only that instead of showing your face, your facial emotions and movements are recorded by a digital avatar. Vtubing has grown considerably more accessible, with a large number of people watching Vtubing videos on YouTube.</p><p>Moreover, Every VTuber is essentially a character. Whether they’re just being themselves on camera or acting out a backstory they made up, watching a VTuber is like watching an anime in and of itself. The avatars or characters provide VTubers with a lot of creative freedom, allowing them to create unique material.</p><p>Being a VTuber isn’t all that different from being a regular one in terms of technicalities. However, it would be beneficial if you still had a good notion of what you want to do with your channel. Even though the two activities are conceptually equivalent, VTubing has a little greater entry barrier due to equipment needs.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is a virtual YouTuber?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">What Does It Take to Become a Virtual YouTuber?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to become a virtual youtuber?</a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873313/18544" target="_top" id="1873313"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873313"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1263"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873313/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-a-virtual-YouTuber-3"><a href="#What-is-a-virtual-YouTuber-3" class="headerlink" title="What is a virtual YouTuber?"></a>What is a virtual YouTuber?</h2><p>A virtual YouTuber, or VTuber for short, is an online video maker or entertainment who represents themselves through a virtual avatar. This avatar is created using computer graphics (CG), and it frequently has an anime-inspired look. Most VTubers, as the name implies, utilize YouTube as their primary platform, while others do upload videos or host streams on other platforms (e.g., Twitch, Facebook Gaming, and so on) and are still referred to as such.</p><h2 id="Vtuber’s-Brief-History-3"><a href="#Vtuber’s-Brief-History-3" class="headerlink" title="Vtuber’s Brief History"></a>Vtuber’s Brief History</h2><p>Kizuna AI, a Japanese VTuber, created and popularized the phrase “virtual YouTuber” in 2016. While she wasn’t the first to employ a CG avatar for video blogging, she is almost entirely to blame for the VTubers craze exploding in Japan and then the rest of the world in late 2016. Because Kizuna AI grew in popularity so quickly, new VTubers began to appear regularly. Some creators, who had already established their platform and&#x2F;or displayed their faces on camera, created VTuber versions of themselves simply to jump on the bandwagon.</p><p>According to User Local, a Japanese data technology firm, over 10,000 active VTubers will exist on YouTube alone by 2020. Kizuna AI, who has the highest following of all VTubers on the internet at the time of writing, has over 10 million subscribers across all of her social media sites (YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, and Bilibili).</p><h4 id="Is-VTubers-the-Next-Big-Thing-in-Video-Content-3"><a href="#Is-VTubers-the-Next-Big-Thing-in-Video-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="Is VTubers the Next Big Thing in Video Content?"></a>Is VTubers the Next Big Thing in Video Content?</h4><p>If you follow video marketing trends, you may have seen an uptick in animated videos featuring anime-style avatars.

The industry, according to analysts, is on the increase.</p><p>In 2019, the overall number of VTuber subscribers climbed by 28%, while total views of Vtuber content increased by 99 percent, according to HyperSense.

Consider all these questions to chalk out a basic framework of your video</p><p><strong>The camera is a pivotal element</strong>. Whether it is a smartphone or a hi-fidelity digital camera, it is worthwhile to familiarise the best positions and light orientations and the capacity of the device to produce the best quality picture.</p><p><strong>How is your sound going to be like?</strong> If you are going to talk in the video, it is recommended that you use a microphone. Or else, you can also use background sound. But to mix sound with the video, you’d need an excellent sound editing tool.</p><p>Finally, comes the editing and finishing part. Eventually, you’ll need purposive video-editing software to help you work out the video transitions, sound, and visual effects.<strong>Choose a toolkit that is easy to learn</strong> and that you can get comfortable with so that the job of video editing doesn’t take the focus away from the main task of cooking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/recipe-videos.jpg"                      alt="Recipe Videos"                ></p><p>Now, once you have all the essential ingredients to create your video, start practicing.

Consider spills, drops, overcooking, etc. as part of the process, so keep adequate substitutes to continue with your project unwaveringly. If you are using a phone, keep it fully charged up. And have a plan beforehand about what you should do when you get an urgent call while shooting. Also, consider doing a site investigation of the shooting spot for any fragile items, pointy corners, slippery areas, curious pets, etc. to avoid trips and falls in the middle of the filming, especially when working with a cameraman who’s following your movement. If you are using a tripod, and floor-standing lights, remember to secure the equipment with plenty of adhesive tapes, lest they bump into an expensive trip or fall.</p><h4 id="Step-2-mport-Your-Video-In-Filmora"><a href="#Step-2-mport-Your-Video-In-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: mport Your Video In Filmora"></a>Step 2: mport Your Video In Filmora</h4><p>You need to sync the device that you used to film the video with the computer that has Filmora installed. It may be a phone or a camcorder. Once the devices are synced, you should launch the Filmora software and go the <strong>“Media”</strong> button at the top right toolbar. There you will find the <strong>“Import”</strong> button. You will get a pop-up message asking you to choose the type of device. Select the right one, and your video will be imported in the Filmora interface.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Edit-Video-Pace-Time-Lapse-Jump-Cut-Slow-Motion"><a href="#Step-3-Edit-Video-Pace-Time-Lapse-Jump-Cut-Slow-Motion" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Edit Video Pace: Time-Lapse, Jump Cut, Slow Motion"></a>Step 3: Edit Video Pace: Time-Lapse, Jump Cut, Slow Motion</h4><p>To create crisp, fast-paced videos, you don’t have to gobble up the content eyeing at the duration. Think smart when you have the resources of a tool like Filmora. Here are the three best features that help you create fast-paced yet well-defined recipes.</p><p><strong>Time-Lapse:</strong> The time-lapse feature allows you to adjust the speed of the video from slow-motion to 10x faster. To use this, double click on a specific clip in your imported video and open the custom speed settings. Use the adjusting meter beside speed to make your clip as fast or slow as you want. You may use the same feature to introduce the slow-motion effects in certain areas of the video.</p><p>Now, when you are using either the fast-forward or slow-motion effects, it is best to have stable video footage with consistent lighting and a static background. There are also the options of Reverse Speed that can play the clip backward, as in flash-back. The Ripple edit feature allows you to cut short a long clip seamlessly.</p><p><strong>Jump Cut:</strong> The Jump Cut is about snipping unwanted areas in the clip. It may sound like the Ripple edit mentioned above, but the ripple edit is more functional for cutting short a continuous video so that the viewer won’t realize the snip. For the Jump Cut, it doesn’t have to be a constant clip. You can get to the next frame or scene with an abracadabra move.</p><p>To use Jump Cut, place the cursor over the starting of the clip that you want to cut, and right-click on it and select <strong>“Split”</strong> (the <strong>“scissors”</strong> feature on the toolbar does the same thing). To make this look neat, preview the portion of the clip once again and delete the cuts between two clips with the same right-click.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Understanding-Transitions-on-Filmora"><a href="#Step-4-Understanding-Transitions-on-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Understanding Transitions on Filmora"></a>Step 4: Understanding Transitions on Filmora</h4><p>Transitions make your video more interactive and help you segregate the video from frame-to-frame with effects like dissolve, fade, flash, etc. there are numerous transition options available within the Filmora suit.</p><p>The best way to do this drag and drop the clips on the timeline is to trim parts of the clip to shorten it. Once you have all the clips in place, go to the <strong>“Transitions”</strong> options at the top toolbar to apply it on the end or start of each clip.</p><h4 id="Step-5-Audio-Playback-Sound-Edits"><a href="#Step-5-Audio-Playback-Sound-Edits" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Audio, Playback &amp; Sound Edits"></a>Step 5: Audio, Playback &amp; Sound Edits</h4><p>There are plenty of options that you can remove background noise, add voiceover, add music, and detach audio from video. Refer to the Audios section from your toolbar.</p><h4 id="Step-6-Save-to-Drive-Emport-Publish"><a href="#Step-6-Save-to-Drive-Emport-Publish" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Save to Drive&#x2F; Emport&#x2F; Publish"></a>Step 6: Save to Drive&#x2F; Emport&#x2F; Publish</h4><p>Once you are satisfied with your content, then go to Export.

If the channel is a niche, it will not make as much money as channels that meet the public’s appetite.</p><p>Lastly, we can’t ignore the quality of videos, can we?</p><p>A high-quality video with multiple transitions, effects, and interactive scenes is a must if you want to gain popularity on your YouTube channel.</p><p>So how can we make our videos top-notch?</p><p>Read on and find the answer in the bonus tip below.</p><h3 id="Bonus-Tip-to-Increase-YouTube-Money-1"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-to-Increase-YouTube-Money-1" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip to Increase YouTube Money"></a>Bonus Tip to Increase YouTube Money</h3><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong></a></p><p>One of the best video editor platforms for pushing the storytelling boundaries of your YouTube videos is Wondershare Filmora.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033095&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Advanced-3YR.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/highest-paid-youtuber-in-the-world-2022-11.jpg"                      alt="wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>This powerful and intuitive video editor is suited for all kinds of content creators, especially YouTubers.

TikTokers are also earning a fortune nowadays. But which one of them is better? Let’s have a look at it.</p><p><strong>Are YouTubers Earning More Money than TikTokers?</strong></p><p>With analysis, it’s crystal clear that YouTubers are making more money than TickTokers, and it’s not without reason.</p><p>In the year 2021, YouTube has paid more than 15 Billion US$ to its creators altogether, according to <a class="link"   href="https://www.jumpstartmag.com/youtube-vs-tiktok-which-platform-pays-its-creators-better/" >JUMPSTART <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. And it’s to be expected because Youtubers have been making content for way longer than TickTokers.</p><p>For example, MrBeast posted his first video on YouTube in 2012, and it has been about 10 years since he created his content.</p><p><strong>Are Highest-Paid YouTube Stars Always Trending?</strong></p><p>Since the highest-paid YouTubers make so much money, you may think they are always “Trending” on YouTube.</p><p>Sorry to pop your bubble, but they are not.</p><p>The highest-paid YouTubers may have a ton of subscribers, but being in “Trending” is different.</p><p>The most important reason is that the “Trending” part of YouTube shows popular videos in the specific area of the users, so it varies depending upon the user’s location.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a

It’s a big world where new things happen every day, in every <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube niche <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. One of the best ways to climb to the top of YouTube’s search engine results is to be among the first creators to make a video about a trending topic.</p><p>But how do you know what’s trending? If you’re in a huge genre like beauty or technology then it’s not impossible to keep track of the latest news and trends, but you probably hear about things as other people start making videos and as websites start publishing articles. How do you get on top of trends just as they’re becoming trends?</p><p>Google Trends, of course!</p><p>Google Trends is a completely free tool you can use to determine what’s trending on YouTube or in Google’s search engine. Here’s how you can use Google Trends to figure out what’s trending in your niche and make a video before there’s tons of competition.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Seeing-The-Big-Picture"><a href="#Part-1-Seeing-The-Big-Picture" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Seeing The Big Picture"></a>Part 1: Seeing The Big Picture</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-use-google-trends-to-come-up-with-video-seeing-big-picture.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends YouTube Ideas"                ></p><p><em>You’ll need to be signed into your Google account to use Google Trends.</em></p><p>Start off at <a class="link"   href="https://trends.google.com/trends/" >trends.google.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and you’ll see what’s trending in general – usually big news stories or things like sports finals. The data is laid out like this: at the top there are three ‘Featured Insights’. These are three of the most popular trending topics paired with graphs of their recent search traffic. Underneath these there will be a list of stories that are currently trending. You can click on them to see charts of their search data and links to where the stories are being covered online.</p><p>Unless you do news or political commentary on your channel these probably aren’t topics you want to cover, but if you like to insert some topical references into your other videos then it’s still good to be aware of these things.</p><p>To get information more relevant to your channel you’re going to have to do some filtering.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Getting-Results-That-Matter-to-You"><a href="#Part-2-Getting-Results-That-Matter-to-You" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Getting Results That Matter to You"></a>Part 2: Getting Results That Matter to You</h2><p>In the Google Trend home page, scroll down to the ‘Recently Trending’ section and click on ‘More Trending Searches’.</p><p>Then click from ‘Daily Search Trends’ to ‘Realtime Search Trends’.</p><p>On top you will see two drop-down menus, one is for the category and one is for location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-video-ideas.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Video Ideas"                ></p><p>Under <strong>All categories</strong> select the general theme your channel falls under.</p><p>Your options are business, entertainment, health, Sci&#x2F;Tech, sports, and top stories.</p><p>It might be the case that your channel doesn’t fall under any of these themes, but there could still be related stories for you in other categories. For example, if you have a beauty channel then there could be something that’d interest you under health, entertainment, or even business.</p><p>Under the <strong>location menu</strong> choose the region most of your viewers are from. This might not be the same as where you are from – you could be in Australia and most of your viewers could be in the U.S. If you’re not sure where your viewers are from you can find out in your <strong>Creator Studio</strong> under <strong>Analytics &gt; Demographics</strong>.</p><p>Once you have narrowed down your results you can just scroll through and pick out a topic related to your channel’s theme that you have something to say about.</p><p>For example, if you have a gaming channel and you’re looking for a non-gameplay topic to make a video on, you would look under Sci&#x2F;Tech. If I look under that category today (May 29, 2017) and specify that I want topics trending in the United States then these are my top 5 results:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453719/17020" target="_top" id="1453719"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453719"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453719/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-categories.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Category YouTube Video Ideas"                ></p><p>The first two happen to be about gaming. If you, as a gamer, had any strong reaction to either of these topics – whether it’s that you feel like you’re knowledgeable about them, or that you’re excited by something that’s coming up, or that something made you groan – then that would be a sign that you should make a video. Capitalizing on a trend while also covering a topic you have a lot to say about is always a good move.</p><p>Having something to say doesn’t have to mean having a strong opinion. If you just find something interesting and want to pass the information along to your viewers then that’s great too.</p><p>Clicking on these results will give you more specific data including how often the topic has been searched recently and links to recent news articles. These can give you a better idea of why it is trending and help you come up with what you want to say.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082538/7443" target="_top" id="2082538"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082538"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082538/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Battle-of-the-Keywords"><a href="#Part-3-Battle-of-the-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Battle of the Keywords"></a>Part 3: Battle of the Keywords</h2><p>Once you have a topic in mind for your next video – whether it came from Google Trends or your own noggin – think about what the most important keyword for that topic might be.</p><p>A <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/the-12-step-youtube-seo-guide-for-beginners-who-want-more-448.html" >keyword is a word or short phrase <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that people type into a search engine like Google or YouTube.

Is this a review, a tutorial, or a how-to? By clicking on my search term Filmora, I can edit it to read ‘filmora review’. Then I can click <strong>+ Compare</strong> and type in ‘filmora tutorial’ and ‘how to use Filmora’. Google Trends will create a chart comparing the popularity of those 3 terms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-search-term-comparison.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Filmora Keywords"                ></p><p><em>I also ‘zoomed out’ to 90 days – if I’d only looked at how they compared over the last week my results could have been skewed.</em></p><p>It’s pretty clear from the chart that ‘filmora review’ is the strongest of those 3 search terms. The title of my video should definitely start with the words <strong>Filmora Review</strong> because that is what most people are searching for when they want information about Filmora. Putting your most important keyword&#x2F;search term first in your video titles will help them rank better in the viewer’s search results.</p><p>Although, when you do a comparison like this you should also go to YouTube and search for each potential keyword&#x2F;phrase individually. It might turn out that there is a ton of strong competition for the most popular search term, and not as much for the second or third most popular. Here’s a search for ‘Filmora Review’ on YouTube:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/427477/5172" target="_top" id="427477"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-427477"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/427477/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-youtube-keyword-search.jpg"                      alt="YouTube search Filmora Keyword"                ></p><p><em>If my view of YouTube looks different from yours it’s because I’m using the <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vidiq-vision-for-youtube/pachckjkecffpdphbpmfolblodfkgbhl?hl=en" >VidIQ plugin for Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Ensure your channel is unique and somewhat different from the rest because the contacted companies keep receiving partnering submissions from several other content creators too.</p><p>One important thing is not to send out the same old letter to all 50 companies and keep hoping to receive a positive response from at least one.

Paid Sponsorship</h3><p>Among all sponsorships, paid sponsorship is the most challenging one. Usually, when you review the products of the affiliate links in your videos, you earn revenues, but, in the paid sponsorship you earn by advertising product and company links on your channel.</p><p>When you add the company’s products to your videos, you earn money. It appears at the beginning and at the end of your videos after it is played on your YouTube channel.</p><h3 id="3-Affiliate-Sponsorship"><a href="#3-Affiliate-Sponsorship" class="headerlink" title="3. Affiliate Sponsorship"></a>3. Affiliate Sponsorship</h3><p>It is the easiest of all sponsorships but also the least revenue-generating one too. Affiliate sponsorship works by sharing affiliate codes and links. It is used by your audiences to obtain discounts or offer you a reward.</p><p>There are two types in which affiliate sponsorship works. One is the discounting option where the code is shared and the viewers use these codes to get discounts anywhere between 5-15% in shopping products from that same site. Another option is to use the affiliate code to integrate it into an URL that offers profits to a content creator in form of traffic.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Not just the popular channels, the newbies can also earn YouTube sponsorship when they know the way outs.

The integrated mount makes it simple for anyone who wants to put it on a selfie stick or something else, and it even has a companion app for easy, on the go editing!</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> The Wi-Fi capabilities are great, but the video transfer can take a bit of time due to how large the files may be. So, if you’re uploading the transfer, you may want to consider using the USB port instead. Also, the memory card slot is in an awkward place near the mount, so those with larger fingers may have trouble putting a card in there.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Logitech-BRIO-HD-Webcam-for-Video"><a href="#3-Logitech-BRIO-HD-Webcam-for-Video" class="headerlink" title="3.

You can easily tinker with all of the settings and such in the included software.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> The arm is designed for thick edges; those with flat monitors or borderless monitors may find that it’s difficult to attach it to your monitor. The software is easy to use, but it’s missing a handful of settings that more experienced streamers would want to have available. There is a crop out background feature, but it can be hard to find and use.</p><h3 id="4-PANASONIC-Lumix-G7-4K-Digital-Camera"><a href="#4-PANASONIC-Lumix-G7-4K-Digital-Camera" class="headerlink" title="4.

The dual control dials and the variable touch LCD allow for maximum control, making it simple to film what you want with minimal editing after you’ve filmed.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> There is a tracking focus, which can be good, but it makes the burst rate (which helps with motion blur) a lot slower. It does have a plastic build, rather than metal, so it’s not as heavy duty as other options. And, you need to purchase it with everything included, instead of just purchasing the body.</p><h3 id="5-Sony-CX405-Full-HD"><a href="#5-Sony-CX405-Full-HD" class="headerlink" title="5.

Dual recording options make for great YouTube and other social media use. Lightweight makes it easy to take anywhere.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Connectivity ports are in strange spots, and can be hard to get to.

Along with all this massive inflow, there are scenarios where the video content that you like or wanted to watch gets deleted for any reason. Either the uploading channel deleted the video, or YouTube sometimes deletes videos for violating any of the platform’s rules – showing the dismal message “We’re sorry, this video is no longer available”. You’ll be thinking it is probably impossible to access deleted YouTube videos that you wanted to watch so badly. Though it may be true to some extent, in reality, nothing gets deleted from the internet. To help you watch deleted YouTube videos, we’ll dive into the two most handy methods down below. So, let get started.</p><p>You might be interested in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Make a Playlist of Uploaded Videos and Others’ Video on YouTube&gt;&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos with a URL</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare FilmoraX</strong></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075471/7443" target="_top" id="2075471"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075471"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075471/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title="["></a>[</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084399/18498" target="_top" id="2084399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084399"                      border="0" alt="" width="1125" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084399/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-with-a-URL"><a href="#Part-1-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-with-a-URL" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos with a URL"></a>Part 1: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos with a URL</h2><p>Internet Archive(known as the Wayback Machine) is a website archival system that has been collecting and cataloging websites since 1996. This means the system has effectively saved the site’s current layout and data. This enormous world archive of the Web’s past has amassed over 100 terabytes of storage with around 10 billion web pages.</p><p>On the archive.org website, you can find many of your favorite web site’s “snapshot” at a time in the past. For our case, we need to find and watch deleted YouTube videos, so for that, all we need is the link of the video, and we can most probably find it on archive.org. The steps for finding and restoring deleted YouTube videos are simple and as follows.</p><p>1. First of all, find the URL in your YouTube email, channel account if you’re searching for your uploaded video.

The internet is a global village network. Everything on the internet is connected, and that connection makes it more useful for example, even though a YouTube video might be deleted, you can somehow access and watch the deleted YouTube videos without a URL because people always replicate videos and share them on other YouTube channels or social media platforms. To make sure you get to watch your favorite YouTube video again, we will dive into the vast internet and find the deleted YouTube videos.</p><p>This method can be a bit complicated and would require you to give full attention to find the video you want to watch that badly that you’ve landed on this article.</p><p>1. Open a new tab in your browser and go to the Google search bar. We’re going to employ a technique from the SEO expert’s toolbox – Google Search Operators.</p><p>2. In the search bar, type <strong>“site:<a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/" >www.youtube.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> + name Of TheVideo”</strong></p><p>3. This way Google will crawl all the name relevant videos only from the YouTube databases and move us closer to finding our deleted YouTube video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958379/18409" target="_top" id="1958379"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958379"                      border="0" alt="" width="856" height="508"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1958379/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/goggle-crawl-url4.jpg"                      alt="google crawl url"                ></p><p>4.

Once you find the video URL, you can simply go back to the first method that we discussed and paste the URL into the internet archive. The archive will give you the video and you can enjoy watching a deleted YouTube video.</p><p>Note: If you still cannot find the video using this method, I’m sorry to tell you the video may be completely deleted from the server, and you cannot access it anymore.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip—Make-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip—Make-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Want to make a YouTube video again? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a relatively lightweight and powerful platform you get an intuitive interface and the power to create wonderful, unique content.
