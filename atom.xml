In this article, I’ll highlight 8 tips from the most accomplished vloggers on the Internet, so that you can vlog confidently and make the best YouTube videos.</p><h2 id="1-Be-Authentic"><a href="#1-Be-Authentic" class="headerlink" title="1. Be Authentic"></a><strong>1. Be Authentic</strong></h2><p>People opt to watch vlogs because they want to see something real.</p><p>Vlogging is about honesty, telling a story that is truthful and showing your personality. The most popular vloggers are likable because they don’t deceive the audience, they befriend them. Vloggers treat their audience with respect and that comes from being honest.</p><p>There will be an urge for you to mimic other vloggers, talking and acting the way they do, but savvy YouTube viewers will be able to see your faux personality pretty quickly.</p><p>Don’t focus on your image, but instead focus on your voice. What makes you different? That is how you will build a proper reputation.</p><h2 id="2-Tell-A-Story"><a href="#2-Tell-A-Story" class="headerlink" title="2. Tell A Story"></a><strong>2. Tell A Story</strong></h2><p>A vlog is not an assortment of footage haphazardly put together. A successful vlog must have a story: a conflict told with a beginning, middle, and end.</p><p>When you are casually telling a story to a friend, you are not thinking about the structure or the plot. You are focused on what happened and you want to communicate it as accurately as you can. While vlogging, you should approach it much the same way. Ad-libbing is fine. Stumbling is fine. Going back and repeating a part of the story is fine. By simply getting your story on camera, you now have all the pieces.</p><p>Once all the pieces of the story are captured — including your storytelling, b-roll, and other supportive footage — you must now cut out all the irrelevant or repetitive parts and edit it so it can be enjoyed as one cohesive tale.</p><p>Take a look at this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TiffanyAlvord" >Tiffany Alvord <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and notice how there are jump cuts both to skip information that can be assumed by the audience and add the tension to the story she’s telling.</p><h2 id="3-Surprise-and-Delight-Your-Audience"><a href="#3-Surprise-and-Delight-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="3. Surprise and Delight Your Audience"></a><strong>3. Surprise and Delight Your Audience</strong></h2><p>There is a saying that a great ending to a story is that it is <a class="link"   href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kudler/writing-the-inevitable-bu%5Fb%5F1630419.html" >surprising, yet inevitable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>The ending needs to be justified even if there is a twist. Everything before that had worked to build up the tension and when it concludes it needs to be logical. However, the ending cannot be something that the audience can guess. Remember those mystery movies where you know who the murderer is after the first few scenes? Yeah… those aren’t satisfying. A good story ends with a surprise, and with everything prior leading up to it.</p><p>The gold standard example of a surprising, yet inevitable end is Casey Neistat’s bike lane video. Everything in the video is leading up to the end, but when you watch it the first time it’s unexpected, and that’s why it’s so good.</p><h2 id="4-Be-Inviting"><a href="#4-Be-Inviting" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Inviting"></a><strong>4. Be Inviting</strong></h2><p>A common trait of successful vloggers is that they are welcoming. They share their passion and encourage others to join in. Vlogging is about being a guide. It doesn’t matter if you are leading a tour of your home or showing your viewer an interesting new skill, it is important for you to approach the whole process with open arms.</p><p>Unlike being invited to a party, there is no obligation when it comes to YouTube. Your viewers can continue to live vicariously through you or they may be inspired by your experience and dare to try it themselves.</p><p>The opposite of inviting is rejecting, and when you are a vlogger, you don’t want to reject anyone from enjoying your videos.</p><h2 id="5-Compose-the-Shot"><a href="#5-Compose-the-Shot" class="headerlink" title="5. Compose the Shot"></a><strong>5. Compose the Shot</strong></h2><p>Vlogging is a visual medium, and while the story is important, what is captured in the frame will play an impactful role in the video as well.</p><p>In a way, every vlogger needs to have a director’s eye for cinematography. I’m not saying that you need to be Wes Anderson to be an awesome vlogger, but knowing what is in the frame with you, the angle of the shot, the movement of the camera, and the quality of light will help the product look better.</p><p>The great thing about vlogging is that you will get a lot of practice framing shots, so I encourage you to learn <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the basics of video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Check out this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjwmbv6NE4mOh8Z8VhPUx1Q" >Rosanna Pansino <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, where she gives a tour of her bedroom.</p><p> The camera follows her fluidly throughout the video, but it is her eyes that guide both the camera moves and what she wants our attention to be directed to. Don’t hesitate to let the viewer know what you want them to see.</p><h2 id="6-Be-Prepared"><a href="#6-Be-Prepared" class="headerlink" title="6. Be Prepared"></a><strong>6. Be Prepared</strong></h2><p>While you can pick up a camera and start vlogging on the fly, being prepared enables you to produce the best video possible. Take a few minutes before you hit record simply to outline the key points you want to talk about and how the video will end, ensuring that after filming you haven’t forgotten a crucial part.</p><p>Additionally, knowing what to say makes you a better host for your vlog. Watch your favorite vlogger, I bet when they are speaking on camera, their speech is not littered with umms and ahhs…</p><p>Good preparation includes having all your gear ready for filming when you need it. There is nothing worse than being set to shoot and running out of battery or memory.</p><p>Take a look at <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8GTe3Wn7dtWXf3B%5Fv5gm9w" >Ashley Nichole <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in this vlog and notice that although she sounds spontaneous, it is also evident that she knows what she is going to talk about next.</p><h2 id="7-Be-Expressive"><a href="#7-Be-Expressive" class="headerlink" title="7. Be Expressive"></a><strong>7. Be Expressive</strong></h2><p>Remember those teachers that drone on and on, without adding any expression or passion to what they are lecturing? While they might have been perfectly suitable as teachers, they wouldn’t make good vloggers.</p><p>If you speak on camera in a monotone voice, you are not being expressive. Your facial and body language will match your lackluster performance. Even if you are talking about something you are excited about, if your demeanor doesn’t match that, then the video is going to be lifeless. Vlogging is a presentation, a performance. There needs to be energy.</p><p>Consider your audience: they are coming home from school or work, where there were classes and meetings, and the last thing they want to watch is a video of your speaking without energy.</p><p>Want to see a vlogger that is awesome at being expressive on camera? Check out <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC78cxCAcp7JfQPgKxYdyGrg" >Emma Chamberlain <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, if you haven’t already. Every word she says in her video is layered with emotion. We know exactly how she feels.</p><h2 id="8-Stay-Organized"><a href="#8-Stay-Organized" class="headerlink" title="8. Stay Organized"></a><strong>8. Stay Organized</strong></h2><p>The same way you should prepare before filming, it’s also important to be organized comes the editing phase. Editing is arguably the most time-consuming part of the vlogging process, so have a system for categorizing and finding your footages.</p><p>This is especially important when you have multiple video and audio files and if you are capturing footage over a number of days or in different locations.</p><p>Additionally, while filming your vlog, you are going to mess up. It’s also helpful to add a cue after you messed up, this can be a sound cue that causes the levels to spike (clapping or snapping your fingers work) or a video cue such as a dramatic gesture to the camera. When skipping through your footage to find the part where you messed up, later on, it’s easier to have a mark to help you locate it.</p><p>Vlogging is hard, so don’t make more work for yourself. Learn little tricks to make life easier for yourself at every step.</p><p>The more organized you are the more attention you can put into the creative aspect of vlogging, and less time finding a video file or syncing audio to video.</p><p>There you have it, 8 tips to help you vlog like the pros. Anyone can vlog. But only until you point a camera at yourself in public for the first time, do you realize how uncomfortable vlogging can be.</p><p>Even filming yourself in your room with the door closed — and nobody is in the house with you — can be a challenge for beginning vloggers. If you find watching your first few videos to be cringy, don’t be discouraged. There are <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >fears of vlogging, but you can overcome them <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Take a look at some of the <a class="link"   href="http://tubularinsights.com/throwback-thursday-first-videos-from-youtubes-top-stars/" >first videos from popular YouTubers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and you can see that everyone had a starting point.</p><p>Do you have any vlogging tricks of your own?

For most, it’s a way to scratch a creative itch, to enjoy being in front of an audience and as an outlet for their talents and opinions. However, the potential to make money on YouTube is huge, and eventually any busy channel is going to start asking itself, how do YouTubers make money?</p><p>This subject is less about ‘if’ you can make money and more about how to make money on YouTube. It’s been proven time and again that the potential is there, with popular stars like Lily Singh and Roman Atwood generating around $8 million a year. And, of course, everyone’s heard of PewDiePie and his whopping $15 million income.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/top-earning-youtubers.jpg"                      alt="youtubers"                ></p><p>You don’t need to have a following of millions to earn money on YouTube though; even small channels have a variety of methods available to them to start making their hard work pay. If you’d like to learn how to make money on YouTube, we’re going to look at eight ways of generating an income via your videos. Let’s get started.</p><h2 id="How-to-make-money-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-make-money-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to make money on YouTube"></a>How to make money on YouTube</h2><ul><li><a href="#part1">Make money on YouTube with ads</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Make money on YouTube without ads</a></li></ul><p>We’ve discovered that making money on YouTube can be split into two main categories; making money through advertising or making money without ads involved. We’ve split our article into these two categories to make it easier for you to see what your options are.</p><h3 id="Make-money-on-YouTube-with-ads"><a href="#Make-money-on-YouTube-with-ads" class="headerlink" title="Make money on YouTube with ads"></a>Make money on YouTube with ads</h3><p>By far the easiest way to start earning money on YouTube is to monetize your channel using ads. Until relatively recently, anyone could enable monetization on their YouTube channel and start earning for every watch of their video. But that all changed in January this year, when Google announced they would be raising the standards required to have ads shown on your channel.</p><p>Now, you need to be part of the YouTube Partner Program (YPP), which means you need to have met certain minimum criteria before you can start benefitting from ads. These include:</p><ul><li>Having 4,000 or more watch hours</li><li>Securing 1,000 or more subscribers in the last 12 months</li></ul><p>This means that, before you can even consider being a part of the YPP, you’ll need to knuckle down and grow your subscribers. There’s lots of helpful tips out there on increasing subscriber numbers, but it all boils down to creating excellent content. As they say, ‘if you build it, they will come’, so work on creating new and exciting content for your channel to get where you need to be.</p><h4 id="Should-you-join-YouTube-partner-or-not"><a href="#Should-you-join-YouTube-partner-or-not" class="headerlink" title="Should you join YouTube partner or not?"></a>Should you join YouTube partner or not?</h4><p>Meeting the minimum requirements of the YPP is crucial to starting to host ads, but even when you’ve hit the 1k subscribers and 4k hours viewed, should you be monetizing your channel right away? Put it this way; in order to make any money from ads, you’re going to need a lot of views and loyal subscribers, which means your focus needs to be firmly on creating content rather than complying with advertising rules.</p><p>Sometimes it’s actually better to hold off for a while when you’re early on in your YouTube journey. This will mean that, rather than being distracted by the question of how to earn money from YouTube, your energy is targeted at what matters most, which is building up a library of awesome videos instead.</p><h4 id="How-to-Join-the-YouTube-Partner-Platform"><a href="#How-to-Join-the-YouTube-Partner-Platform" class="headerlink" title="How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform?"></a>How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform?</h4><p>1. Go to your <strong>Account Settings</strong> and, under <strong>Channel</strong>, select <strong>Status and features</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/monetize-creatorstudio.JPG"                      alt="monetize creatorstudio"                ></p><p>2. Click on <strong>Enable</strong> next to <strong>Monetization</strong>.</p><p>3. In the next screen, click the blue <strong>Enable my Account</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/monetize-enablescreen.JPG"                      alt="monetize enablescreen"                ></p><p>4. <strong>The YouTube Partner Program Terms</strong> will pop up. Compared to a lot of the “Terms” you are asked to read and agree to when signing up for things online the Partner Terms are fairly short and readable.</p><p>5. After reading the terms there are three boxes you will need to check to proceed. The first is to confirm that you read the Terms. The second box is a promise not to click on the ads in your own videos to try to create profits artificially.</p><p>The third box requires you to promise not monetize content that you do not own. The most extreme version of this would be stealing somebody else’s video and trying to monetize it on your channel. However, using a song or sound effect in your video you do not have the rights to also counts. There are a lot of places you can get free music to use in your monetized videos, and YouTube’s own Audio Library is one of them.</p><p>6. After you have checked all the boxes and moved on you will see a pop up explaining how to monetize your individual videos.</p><p>Your channel is now monetized, but you will not be able to earn money until you have linked your channel to your AdSense account.</p><p>7. There will be a reminder to link your channel and your AdSense account in the next screen. Click on the <strong>Link my account</strong> button. Or, go to Google.com&#x2F;adsense and click <strong>Sign Up Now</strong>. Either method will take you to the Welcome to AdSense page.</p><p>8. Click <strong>Sign In</strong> to sign in to your Google account, which is the same as your YouTube account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/monetize-adsense.JPG"                      alt="monetize adsense"                ></p><p>9. After you have signed in it will show you your channel url next to <strong>My website</strong> and give you a chance to change your language. Click <strong>Continue</strong>.</p><p>10. The last step is to fill out all your contact information before you submit your application. Your approval should come within two days.</p><p>11. Go to your <strong>Video Manager</strong> and check the boxes next to all the videos you want to enable ads for.</p><p>12. Click on <strong>Actions</strong> and then select <strong>Monetize</strong>.</p><p>13. In the window that pops up you will be given a chance to choose what kinds of ads you want to allow in your videos. You must also specify here if you have included paid product placement in your video.</p><p>14. Wait for the review process to finish and ads to start appearing in your videos. If you are using any licensed, royalty free, content (like a music track) then YouTube may ask you to prove you have the rights to it.</p><h4 id="How-much-you-can-get-from-Ads"><a href="#How-much-you-can-get-from-Ads" class="headerlink" title="How much you can get from Ads"></a>How much you can get from Ads</h4><p>The ad revenue generated on YouTube is split between Google and you. You’ll get 55 per cent and Google &#x2F; YouTube will take the remaining 45 per cent. This means that, if an advertiser spends $200 on your channel, you could be earning $110 directly. You’ll earn both for ‘impressions’, which is the number of views the ad received, and ‘click throughs’, which is when someone clicks on the ad for more information.</p><p>Be aware that, in order to get paid, your audience will need to have viewed at least 30 seconds of the ad, or to have clicked through to the advertiser. As a rule, around 15 per cent of viewers will convert into ad revenue, so you can start to calculate just how much your video could be worth.</p><p>To give you an example, if you enjoy daily video views in the region of 3,000 views per day and achieve click through &#x2F; view rates of the average 15 per cent, you’d be earning $0.85 - $1.40 per day or $25 - $43 a month for that one video. If you could increase your views to 5,000 per day, your monthly earnings would rise to $41 - $70 per month.</p><p>When working out how to make money on YouTube, keep in mind that every single video has the potential to earn you money. Although one video might only make a dollar a day, imagine when you’ve got 10 videos performing to the same standard, or 100. As you build up your library of content, you have the potential to earn exponentially more as time goes on.</p><p>Want to know how much you can get from Ads?

In order to get more and better brands advertising in your space, you’ll need to make sure you’ve done all that you can to make your channel attractive to them.</p><ol><li><strong>Target a specific demographic</strong></li></ol><p>Your advertisers want to place their products in front of a very specific audience, so the more embedded in your niche your videos are, the more likely you are to attract investment. If you try to be all things to all people, advertisers are going to see that you’re a risky prospect and will move on to a channel that’s more targeted.</p><p>To check demographics, YouTube has everything already there for you. In the YouTube Studio, you’ll find the exact demographics of your audience profile, including age, country of origin and gender. You can see how appealing your videos are to the people you are targeting by checking the spread of representation here.</p><ol><li><strong>Pay attention to your video metadata</strong></li></ol><p>YouTube metadata is an often-overlooked element of content that is actually incredibly important, both for advertising revenue and for views in general. What we mean when we talk about metadata is your tags, title and description of your video, all of which should make use of high traffic keywords that you’ve researched as being relevant.</p><p>YouTube’s own keyword suggestion tool can be a great place to start finding those golden keywords that will get you noticed. Advertisers often use your metadata to locate videos that their customers are watching, so SEO is crucial here. Not only that, but when viewers are looking for new videos to watch, the SEO of your metadata will define where in the search results you fall, so putting some time and energy into this can get you more views too.</p><ol><li><strong>Avoid dodgy video content</strong></li></ol><p>There are some types of content which are just not a good idea for YouTube. In fact, the platform could exclude you from advertising altogether if your content is found to contain any of the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Sexually suggestive content</strong>: This includes making jokes based around sexual topics, as well as partial nudity of anyone in the video.</li><li><strong>Violence</strong>: This ranges from topics of extremism to videos of people sustaining serious injuries, as well as threats and suggestions of violence.</li><li><strong>Inappropriate language</strong>: Even the most popular YouTubers have started bleeping out their profanities, so avoid vulgar language or anything that could be construed as being threatening.</li><li><strong>Drugs</strong>: Promotion of the use, sale or abuse of drugs and other controlled substances is forbidden.</li><li><strong>Sensitive</strong> <strong>subjects</strong>: This includes references to wars, race crimes, natural disasters, political conflicts, even if you don’t show images of the situation itself.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flagged-content-on-youtube.jpg"                      alt="flagged content"                ></p><p>When you’re considering how do YouTubers make money, you should recognize that those who make the most money avoid creating content that breaches any of these rules. YouTube does notify you if it feels your video is in breach of ‘advertiser friendly’ policies, and you’ll have the chance to contest the ban, but if you steer clear of dodgy content in the first place you shouldn’t run into any issues.</p><h3 id="Make-money-on-YouTube-without-ads"><a href="#Make-money-on-YouTube-without-ads" class="headerlink" title="Make money on YouTube without ads"></a>Make money on YouTube without ads</h3><p>Of course, life is not all about ads, and with YouTube continuing to tighten its criteria around advertising it can be a good idea not to have all your eggs in one basket. Add to this the huge viewership you’re going to need in order to make serious money, it’s worth investigating other methods of making money on YouTube. Here are some of the best ideas.</p><ol><li><strong>Work with brands</strong></li></ol><p>Influencer marketing is big business right now, and brands all over the world are investing in individuals who have secured the loyalty and trust of their target demographic. Sponsored videos might feature product placement, promoting a product from your sponsor, or you may be asked to produce a particular piece of content to support their campaign. Check out influencer marketplaces like Famebit, Grapevine Logic and Crowdtap to see what’s available to you. If you want to make work with brands, you can check out <a class="link"   href="https://www.influenex.com/" >InflueNex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a powerful influencer marketing platform, which will help you to build good relationship with brands.</p><ol><li><strong>Selling products or merchandise</strong></li></ol><p>Selling ‘merch’ is a great way to discover how to earn money from YouTube. T-shirts, tote bags, mugs, hats…whatever fits with you and your brand can become an amazing source of revenue for your business. Not only does this increase your exposure as a brand by putting it out there into the non-YouTube world, it also gives your fans a way to literally buy into what you’re doing.</p><ol><li><strong>Affiliate marketing</strong></li></ol><p>Affiliate marketing doesn’t have to be hard work or complicated. Registering with big sales platforms such as Amazon is often as simple as filling out a couple of forms. Once registered, you can use your own special links to hook your viewers up with a product that you would recommend, and you’ll get a proportion of the final sale value. It’s not only Amazon who offer affiliate programs; most major brands will offer some kind of sales commission, so if you’re in a niche that calls for specialist products to promote, do contact brands directly to find out what they can offer.</p><ol><li><strong>Crowdfund</strong></li></ol><p>If you’ve got an amazingly creative idea but lack of funds is stopping you from putting it into action, crowdfunding could be the way to go. Crowdfunded projects can use the money they make to buy better production equipment, hire people to work on the project, pay for props, anything really. A good way to get started with crowdfunding a particular idea is to create a ‘trailer’ or sneak peek that gives people a better idea of what you want to do. Make sure it gets them so excited that they can’t help but donate to your cause!</p><ol><li><strong>Renting out your video</strong></li></ol><p>You have the ability to rent out individual videos for cold, hard cash, just like a pay per view service. The options for this are in the Creator Studio, where you can set the amount you want to rent it out for as well as creating an enticing trailer to encourage people to buy. Choose to either sell your video permanently, letting the person view it whenever they like, or rent for a limited time, usually 24 to 72 hours.</p><ol><li><strong>License your content to the media</strong></li></ol><p>If you’re lucky enough to make a video that goes viral, you can make serious bucks by licensing it to the wider media. From online news sites to TV shows, there are loads of other content creators out there willing to pay good money to use your amazing clip, and may will reach out to you directly with offers. You can also proactively offer your content for sale via sites like Juken Media, where others can find it and purchase it directly.</p><p>Now you know how to earn money from YouTube, what are you going to try?

Though these days YouTube is also offering a ‘theatre mode’ for the full-screen view along with a skip adoption, yet the quality of its user experience is still isn’t at par with Vimeo.

If a viewer watches more than 30 seconds of the ad or clicks it, then the YouTuber will make money.</p><p>This is a general estimate of how much a YouTuber can make from ads once they qualify:</p><p>- 68% of advertisers ad spend goes to the video creator. If advertisers spend $100, creators get $68.</p><p>- $0.18 is the average rate per ad view.</p><p>- 1000 ad views will equal approximately $18</p><p>- 1000 video views will equal between $2-$5</p><h2 id="Why-It’s-So-Hard-for-YouTubers-to-Make-Money-From-Ads"><a href="#Why-It’s-So-Hard-for-YouTubers-to-Make-Money-From-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Why It’s So Hard for YouTubers to Make Money From Ads"></a><strong>Why It’s So Hard for YouTubers to Make Money From Ads</strong></h2><p>For new YouTubers, it is getting harder and harder to get to that point where their sole income can be from YouTube ads. Before they can make a penny, they must first qualify.</p><h4 id="Monetization-Rules-as-of-January-2018"><a href="#Monetization-Rules-as-of-January-2018" class="headerlink" title="Monetization Rules (as of January 2018):"></a><strong>Monetization Rules (</strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/16/youtube-tightens-rukles/"><strong>as of January 2018</strong></a><strong>):</strong></h4><p>- Creators need 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of view time in 12 months before they can turn on monetization</p><p>- YouTube pays in $100 increments</p><p> Once they have monetization turned on, it’s only the beginning. YouTubers need to create good content consistently. In order to earn $100 for the initial payout, they need an average of 50,000 views. That’s just $100! A lot of views and not a big payout. Hardly enough to quit your day job.</p><p>That is why it is essential to have alternative ways to make money on YouTube, and not rely on the ads shown on your videos. So, without further ado, here are 4 other ways to make money on YouTube:</p><h2 id="1-Sell-Your-Product-or-Service"><a href="#1-Sell-Your-Product-or-Service" class="headerlink" title="1. Sell Your Product or Service:"></a><strong>1. Sell Your Product or Service:</strong></h2><p>YouTube is one of the most effective means of marketing and selling your products and services if you are able to use it effectively and drive people to click and buy.</p><p>Here are some examples of products and services you can offer:</p><h4 id="Products"><a href="#Products" class="headerlink" title="Products:"></a><strong>Products:</strong></h4><p>- eBooks</p><p>- Artwork</p><p>- Licensed content</p><p>- Online course</p><p>- Channel&#x2F;brand merchandise</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jack-paul1.jpg"                      alt="YouTuber Jake Paul "                ></p><p><em>YouTuber, Jake Paul uses eCommerce platform</em> <a href="https://fanjoy.co/collections/"><em>Fanjoy</em></a><em>to sell his merch.</em></p><h4 id="Services"><a href="#Services" class="headerlink" title="Services:"></a><strong>Services:</strong></h4><p>- Consulting work (strategy planner, financial advisor, etc.)</p><p>- Contracting work (designer, developer, etc.)</p><p>- Education (tutor, trainer, etc.)</p><p>- Performance&#x2F;Speaking Opportunities (motivational speaker, musician, etc.)</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sunny-lenarduzzi2.jpg"                      alt="YouTuber Sunny Lenarduzzi"                ></p><p><em>YouTuber and entrepreneur, Sunny Lenarduzzi uses YouTube as a platform to get clients for her consulting business.</em></p><h4 id="How-to-Sell-a-Product-or-Service-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-Sell-a-Product-or-Service-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to Sell a Product or Service on YouTube"></a><strong>How to Sell a Product or Service on YouTube</strong></h4><p>YouTube is a vast platform and if you don’t have a clear direction for what you are selling, you might be making videos for an audience that isn’t interested in buying what you are selling.</p><p>Here is how you should go about selling your product or service on YouTube:</p><p> <strong>1. Your content must be discovered by the right people:</strong> If the wrong people find your content, then you aren’t going to make any sales. To get the right eyes on your videos, you’ll need to do some research on your target audience and what keywords they use when searching for your product or services.</p><p>If you are selling a meditation eBook and guided meditation services, type in some possible keywords in the YouTube search bar. What appears will be some popular searches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/meditation3.png"                      alt="meditation"                ></p><p>From there, take your possible keywords and put them into a tool such as <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to find other related keywords. This will help you create discoverable content that will catch the interest of those who will buy what you are selling.</p><p> <strong>2. Your content must have value:</strong> You cannot start with the Call to Action or try selling to your audience right away. You must first build trust and prove that what you are selling has value.</p><p>Take this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ModernHealthMonk" >Modern Health Monk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a weight loss coach.</p><p>  In the video, he offers tips on how journaling can help the viewer reach their goal. The way he intends to make money is through people signing up for his course. The course is the product he is selling, but he doesn’t say that. He knows the viewers are not there to enroll in a course. They are there to learn about what he is offering.</p><p>The video is over 9 minutes long and not once does he tell his audience to buy anything. However, he does encourage the viewer at the end to download a free eBook. Selling is about focusing on the long game.</p><p> <strong>3. Your content must lead the audience to a place where they can buy:</strong> You don’t want to force people through a door, but you do want the signs to be visible. You will need to direct the viewer to a place where they can make the purchase. YouTube has a few ways to point your viewers in that direction.</p><p><strong>Link in the description box:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/link-in-description-box4.jpg"                      alt="link in the description box"                ></p><p><strong>The YouTube Card:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-tutorial5.jpg"                      alt="youtube card tutorial"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-details6.jpg"                      alt="youtube card details"                ></p><p>You can add one or multiple cards to direct viewers to your website or to another related video.</p><p> <strong>Call to action button:</strong></p><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-to-action-button7.jpg"                      alt="call to action button"                ></strong></p><p>Once the viewer is on your website, make sure the path is apparent as well.

Her YouTube channel gave her an audience and proved to publishers that there was enough demand for her to write a book that people will read.</p><p> As you <a class="link"   href="https://www.moneycrashers.com/get-more-youtube-subscribers-increase-video-views/" >grow your audience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you will find that there will be a demand for certain products or services that don’t already exist. This is where you put on your entrepreneur hat and think of something that your audience will pay money for and make it happen. Odds are, when it happens, it wouldn’t even be a mystery, your audience will tell you to make or supply it.</p><p>For example, <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uke6eXzgjQQ" >Remi Cruz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a YouTuber with over 2.2 million subscribers. Remi created a beauty brand and DIY face mask, <a class="link"   href="https://shophoneypop.com/" >Honey Pop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which could only have happened after taking the time to understand her supportive audience.</p><h2 id="2-Affiliate-Marketing"><a href="#2-Affiliate-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="2. Affiliate Marketing:"></a><strong>2. Affiliate Marketing:</strong></h2><p>Businesses know that there are more eyes watching YouTube than ever — behind Google, YouTube is the second most popular place for people researching what to buy — and influencers and reviews are an effective method of getting sales. You can leverage that by participating in affiliate marketing as a YouTuber.</p><h4 id="How-Does-Affiliate-Marketing-Work-On-YouTube"><a href="#How-Does-Affiliate-Marketing-Work-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How Does Affiliate Marketing Work On YouTube?"></a><strong>How Does Affiliate Marketing Work On YouTube?</strong></h4><p>As a YouTuber, you can share your thoughts on products or services, and if there are products that you recommend, by simply adding a personalized link to the product page, you can get a commission for every sale of that product that came through your link.</p><p>The average affiliate commission rate is between 5% to 30%, with a lot of variables. Some low price range items will have a higher commission, while higher-priced items will have lower commissions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affiliat-link8.jpg"                      alt="affiliate links"                ></p><p><em>Travel YouTuber,</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SorelleIAm"><em>Sorelle Amore</em></a><em>’s affiliate links to her vlogging gears.</em></p><p> Keep in mind that people are most likely going to take recommendations from people they trust. You wouldn’t buy a computer from a nutritionist and you wouldn’t buy vitamins from a gamer, so consider what you are an expert in and what products you have the most authority to speak about.</p><h4 id="What-Videos-Are-Best-for-Affiliate-Marketing"><a href="#What-Videos-Are-Best-for-Affiliate-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="What Videos Are Best for Affiliate Marketing?"></a><strong>What Videos Are Best for Affiliate Marketing?</strong></h4><p>There are no restrictions on what will make a good affiliate marketing video, but there are best practices.</p><p>What’s important is understanding the purpose of the video. If the video is about vlogging microphones, then it makes complete sense to have an affiliate link to your favorite microphone. Odds are the people who are watching the video may be considering buying a new microphone, so the link is helpful for them.</p><p>Here are a few types of videos that make for good affiliate marketing opportunities:</p><p>- Product reviews</p><p>- Top 10</p><p>- How-tos</p><p>- Cheap vs expensive</p><p>- What to pack for…</p><p> <strong>How to Get an Affiliate Marketing Link for YouTube?</strong></p><p>Which affiliate marketing program you choose to sign up with will depend on the products you want to link to through your content. Do some research on what each network has to offer in regards to your niche.</p><p>Here is the list of 4 popular affiliate marketing networks:</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/" >Amazon Associates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://rakutenmarketing.com/affiliate" >Rakuten <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.shareasale.com/" >ShareASale <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://peerfly.com/" >PeerFly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>You can also partner with brands directly as many of them, such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.sephora.com/affiliates" >Sephora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.usa.canon.com/shop/en/catalog/affiliate-program" >Canon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, will have their own affiliate program.</p><h2 id="3-Brand-Deal-or-Sponsorships"><a href="#3-Brand-Deal-or-Sponsorships" class="headerlink" title="3. Brand Deal or Sponsorships:"></a><strong>3. Brand Deal or Sponsorships:</strong></h2><p>Selling out, that is often the thought when we hear creators getting brand deals and sponsorships, but that stigma is unfounded if the brand and the content are properly aligned. As your channel grows, you will begin to recognize brands that match your values — and the values of your viewers — and those that don’t.</p><p>Today, more and more brands are collaborating with YouTube creators, because <a class="link"   href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/advertising-channels/video/youtube-influencer-marketing-rulebook/" >creators are 4x more effective in earning brand familiarity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> than collaborations with traditional celebrities.</p><p>In an ad for Beats by Dre’s #BuiltForBosses campaign, YouTuber <a class="link"   href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-self-made-star-shows-one-way-to-crack-the-gen-z-code-1511719567?mod=e2tw" >Liza Koshy outperformed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the likes of Tom Brady and DJ Khaled.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/perform-the-likes9.jpg"                      alt="perform the likes"                ></p><p>While it does take significant effort on YouTube to acquire a following, it is possible for a YouTube channel with 1,000 subscribers to get a brand deal. Getting the buy-in from brands is a numbers game, and according to <a class="link"   href="https://videocreators.com/how-to-get-started-with-brand-deals-on-youtube/" >Video Creators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the minimal number of views per video shouldn’t be lower than 2,000 if this is the path you want to head in.</p><h4 id="How-to-Get-Discovered-By-Brands"><a href="#How-to-Get-Discovered-By-Brands" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Discovered By Brands"></a><strong>How to Get Discovered By Brands</strong></h4><p>The decision-makers behind brands might not be aware of influencers with a smaller following — those who have just cracked the 5,000 subscriber mark. The odds of a brand reaching out to you, as a small creator, is unlikely to happen.</p><p>If you want to get a brand deal and become an influencer on YouTube, then you will have to put yourself out there to be discovered and that is on an Influencer Marketing Network, such as <a class="link"   href="https://famebit.com/" >Famebit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/famebit-brand10.jpg"                      alt="famebit brand"                ></p><h4 id="How-Influencer-Marketing-Platforms-Like-Famebit-Works"><a href="#How-Influencer-Marketing-Platforms-Like-Famebit-Works" class="headerlink" title="How Influencer Marketing Platforms Like Famebit Works"></a><strong>How Influencer Marketing Platforms Like Famebit Works</strong></h4><p>When you sign up for Famebit or other influencer marketing platforms you have an opportunity to get in front of brands who are seeking influencers to share their product or service.</p><p>Steps to getting a brand deal:</p><ol><li>Find brands and campaigns that match your audience.</li><li>Pitch your creative ideas and present the proposal to the brand within their parameters (product review, 30-60 shoutout, etc.)</li><li>If accepted, you are hired and will begin collaboration with the brand to produce the project.</li><li>Build our content.</li><li>Receive approval from the brand.</li><li>Get Paid!</li></ol><p> Unlike celebrity marketing, YouTube creators have shown brands over the years that they are inventive and clever with how they can present the brand to the audience to drive the best results. This type of independence is what makes YouTube influencer marketing special.</p><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><h2 id="4-Crowdfunding"><a href="#4-Crowdfunding" class="headerlink" title="4. Crowdfunding:"></a><strong>4. Crowdfunding:</strong></h2><p>If you are creating valuable content and have a loyal following, you can start thinking about crowdfunding. It doesn’t take stardom to start asking for donations, pledge, or support from your fans. There is a demand for quality content and if you are creating something of value, even on a free service like YouTube, people will happily pay to support it.</p><p>But how can you approach crowdfunding so it doesn’t look like you are begging?</p><h4 id="3-Popular-Types-of-Crowdfunding"><a href="#3-Popular-Types-of-Crowdfunding" class="headerlink" title="3 Popular Types of Crowdfunding:"></a><strong>3 Popular Types of Crowdfunding:</strong></h4><p><strong>- Tiered Rewards: You can give incentives for your patrons in different tiers. Example: a donation of $2-$10 gives them a shoutout in your next video, a donation of $20-$100 gets them an exclusive spot in a live stream, and more extravagant offerings as the donations increase.</strong></p><p><strong>- Membership:</strong> This method of crowdfunding allows your fans to donate on a recurring basis. Treat your channel like it’s HBO and deliver higher-value content. Your members will be the first to see the increase of quality in and frequency of your work.</p><p>- <strong>Project-based:</strong>  Is there a special project you have in mind, get support for it. A longer-form video or one that your fans have been wanting for a while, by highlighting this anticipated project, you can get more backing behind it financially.</p><p> From Sept-Oct 2011, the YouTube channel Freddiew (aka RocketJump) went on <a class="link"   href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/freddiew/video-game-high-school" >Kickstarter to crowdfund <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>so they can produce a web series called Video Game High School. In 30 days, they were able to surpass their goal of $75,000 with $273,725 and 5,661 backers. The result is a multiple season web series, the first one published onto YouTube in May 2012.</p><p> Without crowdfunding, the project would unlikely have been produced and published for viewers in such a short amount of time.</p><h4 id="Set-Crowdfunding-Goals-to-Encourage-Donations"><a href="#Set-Crowdfunding-Goals-to-Encourage-Donations" class="headerlink" title="Set Crowdfunding Goals to Encourage Donations"></a><strong>Set Crowdfunding Goals to Encourage Donations</strong></h4><p>Have you ever gone up to a friend and ask for $5? What did they say?</p><p>“What do you need it for?”</p><p>We are more willing to give money if we know where it is going. Let your audience know exactly what you are planning to spend the funds on and how it will benefit them. One way to really encourage them is to have a goal, for example, a trip to a conference, and a special video will be produced to highlight the event.</p><h4 id="Set-a-Target"><a href="#Set-a-Target" class="headerlink" title="Set a $ Target"></a><strong>Set a $ Target</strong></h4><p>If you have a pie in the sky goal, you aren’t going to fully leverage the message to your audience. Understand how much money you need to produce a video or to pursue a more ambitious project. What do you need in order to grow and make the best channel you can.</p><h4 id="How-Does-Patreon-Work-for-YouTubers"><a href="#How-Does-Patreon-Work-for-YouTubers" class="headerlink" title="How Does Patreon Work for YouTubers?"></a><strong>How Does Patreon Work for YouTubers?</strong></h4><p>When it comes to crowdfunding for YouTubers, <a class="link"   href="https://www.patreon.com/" >Patreon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is the platform of choice. While other platforms such as Kickstarter or GoFundMe are focused on entrepreneurial pursuits, large projects, or charitable causes, Patreon is designed to support creatives and reward and incentivize donors.</p><h2 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways:"></a><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h2><p>There are many ways to make money off of YouTube, I encourage you to try a few of these different strategies and see how they perform and which one suits your channel and your audience the best.</p><ol><li>Directing your viewers to your website where they can pay for a product or service that you offer.</li><li>Sign up with an affiliate program such as Amazon Associates and create content about interesting products.</li><li>Find brands that match your channel’s values and propose ideas via influencer marketing platforms such as Famebit.</li><li>Set up a Patreon page and encourage viewers to donate to get incentives or to support a bigger better project.</li></ol><p>Got questions about making money on YouTube?

Videos are designed to show off what products can do and explain why customers should go on to make a purchase.</p><p>When you have completed your video, you can register for an affiliate marketing program and then add links to your video. The links can be placed either in the video description or as annotations in the clip itself.</p><p>Amazon affiliate marketers don’t always just produce videos – they can also promote products via articles, written reviews and more.

If you do have a genuine love for the product, this should be reflected in the content and encourage others to make purchases.</p><p>Viewers can often tell when your enthusiasm is not genuine, which is why it’s so important to identify products that really do appeal to you. Make a list of the products or programs you use in your daily life and search online to see if there is an affiliate program for it.</p><p>If this is the case, you simply need to apply to join it. You may find that the product, program or service that you love does not have a program. Should this be the situation, contact partners to tell them about your love for the product or service and see if they can set something up.

One issue for YouTube affiliate marketers is that buyers tend to exit YouTube once they have clicked on your link, whether they go on to buy the product or not.</p><p>It is important to try and get as many views as possible to boost exposure for your video, whilst achieving as many sales as you can. Try to strike the ideal balance between encouraging viewers to make a purchase and to watch as much of your content as possible.

In order to do so, we have to prepare it for success. If you are hoping to optimize a video after it has already been published to YouTube, then you aren’t going to get the best result, because much of optimization is done before the video is even shot.a</p><p>In this article, we will give you<a class="link"   href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S1HmRcFwFVA-DtbFBStNZ3jOsYDNvDhj/view?usp=sharing" >a checklist <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which you should have with you at the very beginning of creating a YouTube video: the ideation stage. As you go through your process, check off each task. By doing so, you can ensure that you have given the video the best chance to rank high and be discovered.</p><h2 id="How-to-Optimize-Your-Video-to-Rank-Higher-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-Optimize-Your-Video-to-Rank-Higher-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to Optimize Your Video to Rank Higher on YouTube?"></a><strong>How to Optimize Your Video to Rank Higher on YouTube?</strong></h2><ol><li><a href="#a">Keep Your Audience’s Attention</a></li><li><a href="#b">Do Keyword Research</a></li><li><a href="#c">Engage Your Audience</a></li><li><a href="#d">Upload YouTube Video in Proper Length</a></li></ol><h2 id="1-Keep-Your-Audience’s-Attention"><a href="#1-Keep-Your-Audience’s-Attention" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep Your Audience’s Attention:"></a><strong>1. Keep Your Audience’s Attention:</strong></h2><p>Even though your view count is going up, it doesn’t mean your audience is watching your video. And if they are not, then YouTube is going to consider your video less valuable and therefore, lowering its rank.</p><p>Audience Retention is an important metric to keep an eye on after every video you’ve published.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/measurign-audience-retention.png.png"                      alt="low-audience-retention"                ></p><p>Before you start your next project, take a look back at the Audience Retention of your previous videos.  </p><ol><li>Enter YouTube Studio in your channel</li><li>Access to Analytics</li><li>Select the video you want to review</li><li>Click into engagement</li><li>See where a dip in watch time</li></ol><h3 id="What-is-Good-Audience-Retention"><a href="#What-is-Good-Audience-Retention" class="headerlink" title="What is Good Audience Retention?"></a><strong>What is Good Audience Retention?</strong></h3><p>If you want to see how your Audience Retention is performing, the Average Percentage Viewed will give you a broad perspective. The higher the percentage, the more people are watching your entire video.</p><p>If you get above <strong>60%</strong> Average Percentage Viewed, you should feel very proud. In our modern world with our short attention span, that is considered good retention.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/audience-retention-one.png"                      alt="audience-retention-one"                ></p><p>In the example above, we see that on average, a viewer will only see 44% of the video. For the video below, we see that it only has 30% of the video viewed. Overall, the first video is performing better.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/audience-retention-two.jpg"                      alt="audience-retention-two"                ></p><p>There is also a dip that happens at the beginning in the second example, which indicates that viewers are skipping forward and about 20% then deciding it’s not worth continuing. It’s good data to help you improve your introduction and the hook.</p><p>If there is important information that you are presenting at a given point and in the Audience Retention you see that only a small percentage of your viewers actually see it, then for the next video, you might want to position the details in a different point in the video.</p><h3 id="How-to-Improve-Audience-Retention"><a href="#How-to-Improve-Audience-Retention" class="headerlink" title="How to Improve Audience Retention"></a><strong>How to Improve Audience Retention</strong></h3><p>Here are a few ways you can retain your audience’s attention if you noticed a drop in viewership:</p><p><strong>- Film a hook</strong> (introduce your video to let the audience know what to expect)</p><p><strong>- Add b-roll</strong> (having supplemental footage to cut to makes your video more interesting to watch)</p><p><strong>- Have a co-host</strong> (Having someone on screen gives the video more dynamic interactions)</p><p><strong>- Edit out the unimportant stuff</strong></p><p><strong>- Write a conclusion</strong> (having a conclusion prepared will allow you to transition from the content of the video to the call to action without the audience even knowing) See this example by PolyMatter below and notice how seamless their ending is.</p><p>If you have a video that is doing a good job retaining the audience, then replicate it. If there isn’t, keep experimenting with new structures. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Improving audience retention <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is not simply important for your ranking, but it will affirm that you are building quality videos.</p><p>Knowing how to structure your video will allow you to be strategic as you build out your content.</p><h2 id="2-Do-Keyword-Research"><a href="#2-Do-Keyword-Research" class="headerlink" title="2. Do Keyword Research:"></a><strong>2. Do Keyword Research:</strong></h2><p>Many viewers find YouTube videos via search, and if you aren’t using the appropriate keywords, then YouTube won’t be able to identify your content and display it for your viewers.</p><h3 id="Where-Do-Keywords-Appear-on-YouTube"><a href="#Where-Do-Keywords-Appear-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Where Do Keywords Appear on YouTube?"></a><strong>Where Do Keywords Appear on YouTube?</strong></h3><p><strong>- Title:</strong> Have keywords at the beginning of the title and limit them up to approximately 60 characters so it appears in full in search.</p><p><strong>- Tags</strong>: Include 10-15 tags from general keywords to more specific.</p><p><strong>- Descriptions:</strong> Put important information and keywords at the beginning of the description so both searcher and the search engine understands what the video is about.</p><h3 id="Why-Keywords-Matter"><a href="#Why-Keywords-Matter" class="headerlink" title="Why Keywords Matter"></a><strong>Why Keywords Matter</strong></h3><p>keyword arrangement is an integral part of <strong>YouTube optimization</strong> because the robots behind YouTube don’t associate the value of the actual video content with what the viewer is actually seeking. You should pay attention to the relevance of keywords.</p><p>Even when you add closed captions, it doesn’t mean the best keywords are present to the Youtube search engine when we speak.</p><p>That is why it is important to know your audience and what words and phrases they are going to use to search for your video.</p><p>Here is how you can see what keywords were used to find your video:</p><ol><li>Enter YouTube Studio in your channel</li><li>Access Analytics</li><li>Select Reach</li><li>Click into Traffic Source</li><li>Click Traffic Source: YouTube Search</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/traffic-source-youtube-search.png.png"                      alt="traffic-source"                ></p><p>If you want to find some new keywords for your upcoming video, you will need to do some research.</p><p><strong>1. Enter Keywords You Want to Rank for In YouTube Search:</strong> This allows you to see what the most popular phrases are in the YouTube search engine.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/search-for-keywords.png"                      alt="search-for-keywords"                ></p><p><strong>2. Study the Competitors:</strong> See which videos are ranking high for your search term. Use a tool called <a class="link"   href="https://vidiq.com/" >VidIQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to see the keywords that the top videos are performing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/vidlq-tool.jpg"                      alt="vidlq-tool"                ></p><p><strong>3. Search for Related Keywords and Evaluate Relevancy:</strong> A tool called <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>can help you find related keywords and allow you to identify the search volume, cost per click (aka CPC is used for determining the budget for paid search), and the competitiveness of the word or phrase.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/ubersuggest.jpg"                      alt="ubersuggest"                ></p><p><strong>Search volume:</strong> The number of searches with that particular keyword. The higher the number the more popular it is. You should aim to use keywords with a high search volume.</p><p><strong>Keyword competition score:</strong> This score is usually indicated by a number and it represents how difficult it is for a keyword to rank due to other pages already ranking for that word or phrase. You want to find a keyword with a low competition score.</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> The best combination is high search volume and low competition score. But if you can’t get that perfect mix, go for the low competitive score, as it will give you a better chance to rank, even if it isn’t searched as often.</p><p><strong>4. Come Up With Content Related to Those Keywords:</strong> To come up with topic ideas around a keyword, you can use a tool called <a class="link"   href="https://answerthepublic.com/" >Answer the Public <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which gives you all the most popular questions searched online.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/answer-the-public.jpg"                      alt="answer-the-public"                ></p><h2 id="3-Engage-Your-Audience"><a href="#3-Engage-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="3. Engage Your Audience:"></a><strong>3. Engage Your Audience:</strong></h2><p>It’s been highly discussed on forums all over the Internet, and there appears to be a strong correlation between <a class="link"   href="https://backlinko.com/youtube-ranking-factors" >YouTube video ranking and the number of likes, dislikes, and comments <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the video received.</p><p>While YouTube itself might not be using the number of likes and comments to determine where your video rank, having high engagement allows your video to be discovered through other means.</p><p>Here is an example of how it would work:</p><p>- A YouTuber with 100,000 subscribers views your video and likes it</p><p>- Then your video might be visible to a fraction of those 100,000 subscribers.</p><p>- Boom! Domino effect!</p><p>- More people will see your video and like it, increasing your network of viewers and your watch time, which is one of the main factors that YouTube takes into consideration.</p><p> <strong>Get engagements with a call to action</strong>:</p><p>- Don’t be afraid to ask for an engagement at the beginning of the video to avoid fall off on retention.</p><p>- Encourage them to leave a comment or start a discussion by asking a question at the end of your video.</p><p>- Monitor comments and responds to them so you can build a relationship with your audience over time.</p><p>It’s all about creating a community and that is what YouTube encourages.</p><h2 id="4-Upload-YouTube-Video-in-Proper-Length"><a href="#4-Upload-YouTube-Video-in-Proper-Length" class="headerlink" title="4. Upload YouTube Video in Proper Length:"></a><strong>4. Upload YouTube Video in Proper Length:</strong></h2><p>YouTube puts a lot of weight on watch time, and in addition to that, it puts more weight on session watch time.</p><p>Session watch time is counted when people watch your video and then continue to watch others, it doesn’t have to be your own. The more time people spend watching YouTube videos, as a result of your content, the more likely YouTube will increase your ranking.</p><p>Since YouTube puts importance on time spent watching videos, the length of your video will play a key role.</p><p>If you have 5 videos and all of them are a minute long, a 100% watch through will only get you 5 minutes total.</p><p>However, if you have 1 video that is 20 minutes, and an average viewer only watches half of it, then you have an average watch time of over 10 minutes. <strong>That’s more than double what your five short videos can do.</strong> This longer video is worth more. However, if that 20-minute video is really boring and people drop off in the first minute, then it’s not any better than 1 of the 5 short videos.</p><p>If your format allows, go for a longer video instead of a shorter one.

What’s the ideal YouTube thumbnail Size and Dimension?"></a><strong>1. What’s the ideal YouTube thumbnail Size and Dimension?</strong></h2><p>An essential thing that every YouTube video developer needs to know is about the selection of the right side of the thumbnail for any video. As per the guidelines circulated by Google itself, the most appropriate size for the thumbnail image is 1280x720 pixels, where the recommended minimal pixel width is 640 pixels. Generally, the 16:9 ratio is considered as an ideal choice for Most of YouTube previews and players.</p><p>Here is one interesting thing that you need to know; the thumbnail of videos appears smaller during searches, but it naturally grows to the full size of a video during suggestions. Now the fact is that upscaling of images often loses the quality of content, whereas it is much easier to downscale larger images into smaller ones. Hence, the best idea is to use large size images so that this search and suggestion based scaling needs can be well accomplished.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 12 Best Free YouTube Thumbnail Makers &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" > How to Download YouTube Thumbnail in 3 Ways [Online&#x2F;Win&#x2F;Mac] &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="2-Tips-for-Perfect-Thumbnails"><a href="#2-Tips-for-Perfect-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="2.

Tips for Perfect Thumbnails</strong></h2><p>So, if you are ready to add thumbnails to your videos, then it is time to learn a few essential tips to do this task with improved impact. You need to ignore the blurry details and boost the eye-catching ones.

Although the idea is good and original, these thumbnails use to be of low quality with blur details. Hope! You don’t want to lose your audience with this bad selection.</p><h4 id="Custom-Thumbnails"><a href="#Custom-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Custom Thumbnails"></a><strong>Custom Thumbnails</strong></h4><p>This is probably the best choice for your customized videos, and the interesting thing is that here you can control everything manually with lots of useful effects.</p><p>First of all, you need to open your video on YouTube and then scrub a useful still from your video that you wish to use as a thumbnail.</p><p>Now, you need to take a screenshot of this particular instance of your video file. The best part is that most of the operating systems allow users to enjoy several shortcuts to complete this task. For example:</p><p>Mac users need to press Command+Shift+4 and then simply highlight the area that you want to include in your screenshot with the help of a frame. The system will automatically save your selected area to your desktop in the form of an image.</p><p>Window users are advised to access Windows Key with Print Screen option to get their desired screenshot.</p><p>Once you are ready with your video specific still image, then simply get it uploaded on YouTube using the edit video page.</p><h2 id="3-Making-Better-Thumbnails-for-YouTube"><a href="#3-Making-Better-Thumbnails-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="3.

You can use an advanced tool like Photoshop or a free online tool like Canva.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Focus on Size:</em></strong></li></ul><p>It is always advised to create thumbnail images with standard video file size; the most commonly used standard size range is 1980x1080 or 1280x720. Images having a size smaller than this range may often appear blurry.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Add Text:</em></strong></li></ul><p>The best idea is to use text-based editing for your thumbnail images and preferably add the title of your video to this image. It will naturally attract more viewers.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Borders matter:</em></strong></li></ul><p>Professionals recommend adding borders around thumbnail images but do not try to make it too thick rather, try to make it noticeable with fine details.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Background editing:</em></strong></li></ul><p>Most of the expert video thumbnail developers prefer to change the impact of thumbnail background by simply replacing the background color with solid colors. It will definitely attract more viewers and will bring major attention to the major subject.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Test it before uploading:</em></strong></li></ul><p>Before uploading your customized thumbnail to your YouTube channel, prefer to check its final view. Zoom in to check the appearance of the thumbnail image on the larger screen, and it should also look fine when sized down.</p><p>Now that you know the best YouTube thumbnail size and how to design better thumbnails, do you think you’ll revisit the thumbnails of your existing YouTube videos?</p><p>If you want to find a video editing solution that empowers your imagination and creativity yet takes less effort, please try this robust and user-friendly video editing software <strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong>.

However, there are certain regulations and norms by the tech giant - Google that you need to comply with in order to get your wallet stuffed.</p><p>With that said, the following sections explain some of the practical methods to earn money from Google and YouTube and how YouTube Shorts contributes to the process.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-Money-on-YouTube-Shorts-Practical-Way"><a href="#How-to-Make-Money-on-YouTube-Shorts-Practical-Way" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Money on YouTube Shorts? (Practical Way)"></a>How to Make Money on YouTube Shorts? (Practical Way)</h2><p>The good news is, you are not solely dependent on YouTube Shorts to generate funds from the Internet. In fact, there are several other means that can help you with that. Some of the practical ways that YouTube and Google allow you to earn through include:</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube Shorts Fund</strong></li></ul><p>YouTube Shorts Fund is a $100 million fund that is to be distributed from 2021 to 2022. It was introduced in May 2021 as the first step for YouTube Shorts monetization. YouTube Shorts creators that meet the requirements of the fund will receive the bonus.</p><p>To be eligible for the YouTube Shorts Fund bouns, you will need to meet the below requirements.</p><ul><li>Publish one eligible Short in the last 180 days.</li><li>Your channel does not conflict with the YouTube Community Guidelines, copyright rules, or monetization policies.</li><li>Content needs to be original and unique on the YouTube Shorts platform. Uploading movie clips or re-uploading videos from other video platforms are not allowed.</li><li>The creator must be 13 or older.</li><li><strong>Revenue by Advertisement</strong></li></ul><p>With this method, you can have advertisements displayed on your regular YouTube videos. These advertisements help the streaming media generate funds, some part of which is then shared with you. In a broader spectrum, the more videos your YouTube channel has the more money you make.</p><ul><li><strong>Channel Membership</strong></li></ul><p>If you prepare engaging videos that are liked by the majority of users, you can set up your channel for paid members who may get attractive perks in return.</p><ul><li><strong>Merch Shelf</strong></li></ul><p>In this method, you can sell your (or others) branded products to potential customers for monetary gains.</p><ul><li><strong>Influencer</strong></li></ul><p>If you are good at speaking and can motivate people, becoming an influencer is another method you can make a decent amount of money from YouTube with. When you become an influencer, you can get associated with multiple organizations and companies to promote their products and services and get paid.</p><ul><li><strong>Super Chat and Super Stickers</strong></li></ul><p>If you have a good fan base, you can highlight their messages and chat and can charge them for this.</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube Premium</strong></li></ul><p>You can prepare some engaging and informative videos that are exclusively available for the YouTube Premium members. Because these subscribers have purchased YouTube Premium membership, the streaming platform shares the profit it gets from such users with you.</p><p>The approaches discussed above can help you earn money with YouTube. Now that YouTube has rolled out the plan for YouTube Shorts monetization, we can anticipate more YouTube Shorts monetization in the future. You can also publish your YouTube Shorts video on your channel and the Shorts Shelf. YouTube then suggests these clips to others with similar interests (depending on the keywords that you have added in the description). When such users watch your short videos, the chances are that they would subscribe to your YouTube channel and watch the regular videos that you have already posted, thus helping you make money using any of the methods listed above.</p><p>Another positive aspect of this approach is, the number of views your short videos affects the overall analytics of your YouTube channel (in terms of view count and playback duration), and therefore play a vital role in meeting the minimum requirements as per YouTube policies to get your other, regular YouTube clips monetized.</p><h2 id="Why-did-People-See-Less-Revenue-Than-Regular-YouTube-Video"><a href="#Why-did-People-See-Less-Revenue-Than-Regular-YouTube-Video" class="headerlink" title="Why did People See Less Revenue Than Regular YouTube Video?"></a>Why did People See Less Revenue Than Regular YouTube Video?</h2><p>When you start publishing short videos on your YouTube channel, the views that those clips get also affect the total view count and the playback duration of your channel. Although this helps you reach the minimum threshold for the monetization services that the platform offers, because the short videos cannot be monetized, you may see some depreciation in the revenue generation over time.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Because YouTube Shorts is still in the Beta phase at the time of this writing, the short videos don’t directly contribute to the monetization process. Nevertheless, as mentioned earlier, every time your short clips are viewed, your channel’s analytics are affected as per the view count and the playback time.</p><p>Furthermore, with interesting short videos, your channel is likely to get more subscribers, thus resulting in meeting the minimum threshold to becoming eligible and applying for YouTube’s Partnership Program.</p><p>Regardless of the fact that the revenue may seem deteriorated in contrast with the number of views and play time of the videos, the increment in the number of subscribers and paid members (if your channel allows them) would significantly appreciate your income.</p><p>And the most optimistic part is, Google is still working on and exploring YouTube Shorts. With that, the chances are, even the short videos could be monetized in the future.</p><p>The bottom line is, no matter what the current scenario of YouTube Shorts is, you must ensure to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >create engaging videos for YouTube Shorts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> using any of the tools like Wondershare Filmora in order to attract more subscribers to increase your earnings.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-harmonize-body-and-mind-through-these-top-10-yogis-videos/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Harmonize Body and Mind Through These Top 10 Yogis' Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-from-clicks-to-cash-elevating-exposure-economics/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, From Clicks to Cash  Elevating Exposure Economics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-your-first-steps-in-high-quality-youtubing/"><u>[New] Your First Steps in High-Quality YouTubing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-how-to-delete-youtube-comments-effortlessly/"><u>[New] In 2024, How to Delete YouTube Comments Effortlessly?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-followers-in-motion-analyzer/"><u>[New] In 2024, Followers in Motion Analyzer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-stay-on-top-of-youtube-moderation-standards/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  How to Stay on Top of YouTube Moderation Standards</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-how-many-viewers-equates-to-profit-decoding-youtubes-earnings-formula-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How Many Viewers Equates to Profit?

Here are 3 tools for getting started. Even if you don’t use one of the names you generate you’ll get some great inspiration.</p><h4 id="1-SpinXO"><a href="#1-SpinXO" class="headerlink" title="1. SpinXO"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="http://www.spinxo.com/youtube-names/" >SpinXO <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><p> - Lots of options</p><p> - Checks availability</p><p>This is a great generator. If you were brainstorming yourself, you’d probably write out a bunch of words related to yourself and the kinds of videos you want to make and see what goes together. SpinXO does that for you, and mixes in other words that sound good in usernames.</p><p>Here’s what happened when I tried to name a hypothetical baking channel:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-name-generator-spinxo.jpg"                      alt="youtube name generator spinxo"                ></p><p>Not all of the results are great, but there are some cool sounding options in there.</p><p>One of the most useful features of SpinXO is that you can check the availability of the usernames. I liked the sound of CupcakesCupola, and when I clicked on it I was able to see that nobody else was using it on other sites.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-name-generator-spinxo-2.jpg"                      alt="youtube name generator spinxo"                ></p><h4 id="2-Name-Generator"><a href="#2-Name-Generator" class="headerlink" title="2.

You plunk in a prefix and a suffix, and it generates a random word or term to stuff between them. Here’s what I got for my fictional cupcake channel:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/namegenerator-biz-example.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Name Generator"                ></p><p>So, on one hand - that’s hilarious and I’m considering legally changing my name. On the other hand, all of the results look exactly like this (which means they’re all a bit too long). It shows you a longer list if you scroll down:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/namegenerator-biz-example-generated.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Name Generator"                ></p><p>You can pick your favorite names and it’ll list them out so you can easily copy them into a word document. That’ll be useful if you’re collecting options from several sites.</p><h4 id="3-Username-Generator"><a href="#3-Username-Generator" class="headerlink" title="3.

While some of the creative tools might be expensive, the easy ones have a steep learning curve, and engaging a professional designer wouldn’t be something you might be ready for. <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> is a great solution for any such situation.</p><p>With that being said, the following sections talk about what <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> is, how is it useful, what advantages does it offer, and how can you create professional video adverts using the tool.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is YouTube Video Builder?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How Does YouTube Video Builder Work?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Get YouTube Video Builder?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Make Video Ads for Free with YouTube Video Builder?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Tips for Making Good Video Ads with YouTube Video Builder</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-YouTube-Video-Builder"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-YouTube-Video-Builder" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is YouTube Video Builder?"></a>Part 1: What Is YouTube Video Builder?</h2><p>YouTube recently came up with an online tool, <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong>, that, as the name suggests, enables you as an organization to prepare videos for free. These videos could be anywhere from 6 to 15 seconds long and are most appropriate for advertisements. Once created, the films can be used in the campaigns to promote your brand and&#x2F;or products online.</p><p>However, you must keep the following few things handy before starting with <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> to prepare a video advertisement:</p><ul><li><strong>Logo</strong></li></ul><p>You must have a good-quality photo of your <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >brand logo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that you want to add to the video as a watermark. This gives your organization online recognition.</p><ul><li><strong>HD Images</strong></li></ul><p>At the time of this writing, <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> only allows you to add still images. The tool compiles these photos using a theme that you select, and enables you to add background music to make the advert more engaging. Therefore, it is imperative to have high-definition images of your product(s) that you want to create a promotional video for.</p><ul><li><strong>Google Chrome Browser</strong></li></ul><p>You must have the latest version of the Google Chrome web browser installed on your computer.</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube Channel</strong></li></ul><p>Because <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> will publish your video advertisements on YouTube itself, you must have your own <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Channel created <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, configured, and properly functioning so the posting process remains smooth and seamless.</p><ul><li><strong>Availability of the Tool and Features</strong></li></ul><p><strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> is still in the Beta phase, and therefore you may not have access to all the features that the tool has to offer. However, this majorly depends on the region of your residence. As of now, the utility is not even available in some countries of the world.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-YouTube-Video-Builder-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-YouTube-Video-Builder-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does YouTube Video Builder Work?"></a>Part 2: How Does YouTube Video Builder Work?</h2><p>As explained earlier, <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> is an online tool that works on the latest version of the Google Chrome browser. The web interface of the utility has separate blocks (or placeholders if you want to call them) for different types of images. For instance, there is a placeholder for your logo, and a couple of other blank slots where you can import the photos from your computer.</p><p>There are some text input fields that you can populate with the relevant information such as the name of the video, the product’s name that you wish to promote, and many other things. There is a storyboard at the bottom of the interface that helps give your video a theme and the alignment of the ingredients that you have imported from your computer.</p><p>Finally, you can add background music to the video from the royalty-free tracks that can be accessed from the built-in library, and you are all set to go.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-I-Get-YouTube-Video-Builder"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-I-Get-YouTube-Video-Builder" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can I Get YouTube Video Builder?"></a>Part 3: How Can I Get YouTube Video Builder?</h2><p>Because YouTube Video Builder is in its Beta phase, at the time of this writing you are required to send an access request to Google using your account that you want to use to create the videos from. You can send your requests to: <a class="link"   href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/videobuilderbeta/" >https://services.google.com/fb/forms/videobuilderbeta/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Once your request is approved, you can then use the same Google account to sign in to the <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> portal, and start preparing your video advertisements. Here, it is important to understand that the Google account that you use to send an access request and prepare the videos must be the same ID that has your active and functional YouTube Channel.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Make-Video-Ads-for-Free-with-YouTube-Video-Builder"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Make-Video-Ads-for-Free-with-YouTube-Video-Builder" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Make Video Ads for Free with YouTube Video Builder?"></a>Part 4: How to Make Video Ads for Free with YouTube Video Builder?</h2><p>Once you have access to the Beta version of <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong>, you can start creating the video ads for free. You can learn the process of how this can be done by following the simple instructions given below:</p><h4 id="Step-1-Prepare-a-Console"><a href="#Step-1-Prepare-a-Console" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Prepare a Console"></a>Step 1: Prepare a Console</h4><p>After signing in to your <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> account, on the main interface, click <strong>Select Layout</strong> from the navigation bar at the right if not already selected, pick a layout that best suits your needs, and click <strong>Use Layout</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-select-layout.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Video Builder "                ></p><p>Next, from the <strong>Color &amp; Logo</strong> section, choose the base (background) and text colors using their corresponding tools from under the <strong>Brand colors</strong> section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-select-color-logo.jpg"                      alt="Create video with YouTube Video Builder "                ></p><p>After this, insert an image of your brand logo in the block under the <strong>Logos</strong> category.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-insert-brand-logo.jpg"                      alt="Create video with YouTube Video Builder "                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Add-the-Ingredients"><a href="#Step-2-Add-the-Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Add the Ingredients"></a>Step 2: Add the Ingredients</h4><p>When you are on the <strong>Images &amp; Text</strong> section of the navigation bar, pick the high-definition photos from the <strong>Storyboard</strong> at the bottom, and add them to the <strong>Image 1</strong>, <strong>Image 2</strong>, and <strong>Image 3</strong> boxes accordingly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-insert-images-texts.jpg"                      alt="Create video with YouTube Video Builder "                ></p><p>Now, scroll down to the <strong>Text</strong> section, and add the relevant content in the available text input fields.

The following few tips would help you achieve this with ease:</p><ul><li>Make sure to gather all the ingredients such as the photos of the products, brand logo, etc. before starting with the video creation process</li><li>Set a layout, font, theme color, and background music that compliments the product(s) you wish to promote</li><li>Remain consistent with the theme color, fonts, etc. throughout the video</li><li>Make sure to include a catchy ‘Call for action’ text in your video ad</li><li>Make as many modifications as you want before publishing the ad on your YouTube Channel. Avoid doing any amendments after the ad has been posted</li><li>Share the link of your video with as many people as you possibly can to make your product(s) and brand visible and popular</li><li>Make sure to use the ad in your campaigns to make people aware of your brand&#x2F;product(s)</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The bitter truth is, producing videos, especially for brand promotions requires expert creators, expensive tools, and a good amount of work experience. Although all these can be managed if you have some spare funds, <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> helps you create advertising videos of up to 15 seconds with ease and for free. All you need is access to <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong>, your own YouTube Channel, your brand logo, and high-definition photos of your product(s).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-harmonizing-hit-hits-building-the-perfect-youtube-soundtrack/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Harmonizing Hit Hits  Building the Perfect YouTube Soundtrack</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-finding-the-right-mic-a-guide-for-multifaceted-yt-channels/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Finding the Right Mic  A Guide for Multifaceted YT Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-go-professional-stay-budgeted-top-4-tutorials-on-creating-green-screen-magic-for-cost-free-learning/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Go Professional, Stay Budgeted  Top 4 Tutorials on Creating Green Screen Magic for Cost-Free Learning</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-from-raw-footage-to-riveting-content-the-ultimate-guide-to-yt-video-edits-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] From Raw Footage to Riveting Content  The Ultimate Guide to YT Video Edits for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-how-to-create-a-sports-highlight-video/"><u>[New] In 2024, How to Create a Sports Highlight Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-free-webinar-creation-and-management-on-youtube/"><u>[New] In 2024, Free Webinar Creation & Management on Youtube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-fast-tip-mastering-green-screen-techniques-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Fast Tip  Mastering Green Screen Techniques for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-text-messages-from-samsung-galaxy-f14-5g-to-new-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Text Messages from Samsung Galaxy F14 5G to New Phone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-snap-into-action-efficient-office-photography-tips-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Snap Into Action  Efficient Office Photography Tips for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/does-life360-notify-when-you-log-out-on-nokia-105-classic-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Does Life360 Notify When You Log Out On Nokia 105 Classic? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/reliable-user-guide-to-fix-tecno-phantom-v-fold-running-slow-and-freezing-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Reliable User Guide to Fix Tecno Phantom V Fold Running Slow and Freezing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-the-2024-guide-to-auditory-freedom-through-pazera-extraction/"><u>[New] The 2024 Guide to Auditory Freedom Through Pazera Extraction</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-chuckling-and-crying-on-the-same-ig-feed-top-memetic-pages/"><u>2024 Approved  Chuckling and Crying on the Same IG Feed  Top Memetic Pages</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/perfect-video-demos-in-adobe-captivate/"><u>Perfect Video Demos in Adobe Captivate</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-detailed-guide-on-removing-iphone-8-plus-activation-lock-without-previous-owner-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Detailed Guide on Removing iPhone 8 Plus Activation Lock without Previous Owner?</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

SocialBlade.com is a free-to-use website that displays your YouTube statistics – or the stats of any channel you are interested in – using an intuitive layout.</p><p>While many of the stats you can find on Social Blade are also available right on YouTube, some people find it easier to read on Social Blade. YouTube provides you with a lot of information, and a lot of it might not be useful to all creators.</p><ol><li><a href="#yourstats"><strong>Your YouTube Analytics</strong></a></li><li><a href="#spy"><strong>Spying on Other Channels</strong></a></li></ol><h2 id="Your-YouTube-Analytics"><a href="#Your-YouTube-Analytics" class="headerlink" title="Your YouTube Analytics"></a>Your YouTube Analytics</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/social-blade-youtube-analytics.jpg"                      alt="Social Blade for YouTube Analytics"                ></p><p>Social Blade is an excellent place to gauge the growth of your channel. It provides statistics on our subscribers, views, and estimated revenue.</p><p>To start using Social Blade, type your channel name into the search bar.</p><p>On the top section of the page, several stats will be clearly displayed.</p><p>First, you will see the letter grade assigned to your channel by Social Blade. If it is not a very good one, keep in mind that channels with over 10, 000 might still only receive Cs. Only YouTube megastars are getting As and Bs.</p><p>Next to your grade are your subscriber and video view ranks, as well as a rank assigned to you by Social Blade.</p><p>On the second line, you will see the views and subscribers you got in the last 30 days and the percentage by which you are up or down. Simply searching for yourself and glancing at this line is the easiest way to see whether your channel is growing, even easier than in your YouTube Creator Studio.</p><p>The final line of the first section will show you an estimate of your monthly revenue.</p><p>If you scroll down to the second section you will be able to see your views, subscribers, and estimated earnings per day rather than per month. Growth is in green and loss is in red.</p><p>By looking at this chart you can see which videos benefited your channel most after they were posted (your videos are not listed, but you can see based on the day you posted them). This will give you a good idea of what your audience wants to see.</p><h2 id="Spying-on-Other-Channels"><a href="#Spying-on-Other-Channels" class="headerlink" title="Spying on Other Channels"></a>Spying on Other Channels</h2><p>When you check your stats, you type your channel name into the search bar. If you want to use Social Blade to monitor somebody else’s stats, type their channel name instead.</p><p>By looking up your direct competitors (channels about the same size as yours within your same genre) you will be able to see which of their videos are performing best for them when you combine the daily information Social Blade provides with your knowledge of what videos they posted when.</p><p>Knowing what is working for your rivals will help you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >design your content strategy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>You can also use Social Blade to look up huge YouTube stars who you admire, just to see how well they are doing.

After all, there are some significant advantages to using the former over the latter. For one, YouTube Music offers a broader range of songs and videos without ads.</p><p>Though Spotify is a widely used music streaming app, its many limitations for non-Premium members have driven users to look for alternatives.
